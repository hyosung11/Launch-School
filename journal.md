# Launch School Mastery Based Learning Journey Journal

Started the Prep courses and finished on Sunday, 20210711.
Wrote and sent Assessment email on 20210711
Accepted and enrolled on Monday, 20210712

## 20210712 월요일

Still trying to figure out how best to use Anki cards.
What about agile/scrum development processes to go through the core curriculum?
accountability
daily standup meeting?
work in sprints?
user stories
study group?
LS Slack channel and community
cleaned up the office a little bit
a little tired and scattered at the moment. i had trouble sleeping last night as my mind felt excited to get to work. that's a good sign. this does feel like play to me. i'm having fun and enjoying myself

what type of role and in what kind of company do I want to work?
look at LS95 again

tired today. skipped the first quiz. I want to make my anki cards for the Prep courses and do at least one small problems set

[Six Rules for Good Git Hygiene](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2)

Always `pull` before a `push`.
`pull` frequently.
`push` frequently.
Commit frequently.

* Commit small, single changes with carefully crafted commit messages that tell what the small, discrete change is.
* If you need to use the word 'and', you are not committing enough.

Merge `forward` frequently.
Create `pull requests` infrequently.

Anki cards
Daily Scrum
study buddy
spent a lot of time reviewing the anki cards I made yesterday. I want to make more cards today before I do problems and take the quiz

14:28 still reviewing the Introduction to Programming book and making Anki cards. This is beneficial.

16:12 More review. God, I need to work on the problems instead of just looking at the answer.

17:55 I think reviewing the fundamentals will pay off later.

20:33 Finished Anki cards on arrays.

## 20210714 - 수요일 0:20

done for the day
got through all the Intro to Programming book with Anki cards

   1. I'm good right now

09:36 - pretty much finished Anki card review. I think 100 cards is too much for one review.\
09:50 - doing more cards, but am going to take a break for ten minutes and start working on exercises.\
10:10 - added speed focus mode to anki cards and finished 100 cards.

Use a`\` to create a line break.

[Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/markdown-basics?id=line-numbers)

line-numbers
You can enable line number for a code block by adding line-numbers class.

```javascript {.line-numbers} {highlight=2}
aa
bb
cc
```

* this doesn't show up in GitHub

13:36 - reviewing my notes and code from the Intro to PEDAC study session. Time to take a break and go outside.

15:28 I looked at the PEDAC problem again. I need to train in coding cleanly over and over again.

17:22 worked through some JavaScript Basics exercises. Time to make dinner. I wonder if I should disable some of these extensions?

19:52 made dinner, went for bike ride with SungOh and did Easy 1 > Isn't it Odd? exercise. It was fun to figure out by researching the `Math.abs()` function

21:52 submitted odd_numbers.js solution and looked at the other solutions.

22:10 submitted even_numbers.js solution which was super similar to odd_numbers.js

22:31 started How Big is the room with setup of readline-sync, but going to sleep now.

23:08 Jordan Whistler demonstrated Live Share for VS Code with me.

## 20210715 목요일

09:00 I asked Byron to do a daily scrum/standup at 11:00. We'll see if he responds. I also asked Alex to do a study session tomorrow morning.

09:05 Study Tips from Mandy Cheang (TA)  09:00 => check `mandy_cheang_study_tips.md`

## Mandy Cheang Study Tips from Slack Message

Good morning!
My best tips would probably be:

* mindset, have a growth mindset
* be kind and patient to yourself, take breaks and rest when you need. Your brain also is working in the backend when you're resting. (diffuse mode)
* be self aware, iterate through your process of learning, get feedback, and ask structure questions when you don't understand. So "I tried this and that, my mental model is currently is this. But I don't know what is happening when the output is X, when I expect it to be Y."
* active recall, flash cards, teaching, but have some way to evaluate yourself or something else to evaluate you
* mistakes are opportunities
* try to make as MANY mistakes as you can and figure out the gaps in your knowledge before the assessment / interview
* I use to "highlight and re-read" all the time, it's not effective.
* I do take notes but I take notes in question form and convert them to anki flash cards
* If you are struggling, don't try to tackle everything at once, break it down to the pieces and tackle each piece incrementally. Then everything will come together as a whole. Ex. You can't solve a coding problem within 20 minutes. It's not very effective if you keep coding with other students without working on yourself and the individual pieces your struggling with. In order to get faster, practice being familiar at the methods you can use, be rock solid on loops and iterations, then practice breaking down the problem, practice the algorithm. These are all pieces you can practice individually and be aware which pieces your struggling with and try to tackle that. It's like weight-lifting or playing a sport. If you want to have a strong full body or your training for a sport, you work on biceps for a while, then you work on legs, then everything comes together as a whole.
* Don't worry about learning how to study, it's not a detriment of actually studying. I spent months iterating and learning more on how to learn. It pays dividends and your efforts will compound overtime. Learning how to learn effectively has been the best investment in my life.
* Ok that was a lot. I have more resources for you if you're interested in taking a look. These things have helped me:
* One last great tip is, study with others. If you haven't already, check out the #the-spot you can find a lot of other students on the same course, same path.

[How to Create and Practice Flashcards Like a Boss](https://medium.com/@iDoRecall/https-medium-com-idorecall-how-to-create-and-practice-flashcards-like-a-boss-b7efb5a53293)

* flashcards are utilized for building easy recall of the things that you’ve already learned.
* Create your flashcards while consuming your learning content. (When I use the word content, I’m referring to the academic materials that you can read, watch or listen to.)
* read things only once.
* The only active approach is to _practice retrieving what you learn from memory_.
* Read once and create flashcards as you work your way through the material:
  * capture all the concepts and facts you want to remember
  * Once you have processed that piece of learning content, meaning once you have read it in its entirety and created the necessary flashcards, mark it as completed.
  * Then use the flashcards and retrieval practice as your primary tools for remembering the key concepts and facts forever.
* When you create a flashcard, draft the question and answer from memory.
* On every flashcard, ask only one question and whenever possible, only one answer.
* the most challenging flashcards are the ones where you have to retrieve a large collection of items from memory.
* keep the question concise but make it just long enough to be explicit and clear
* carefully craft your question to elicit the best and most complete answer
  * think like a trial attorney who is examining a witness
* it's better for a question to be longer than the answer
* keep answers short, simple and specific to stimulate synaptic strengthening.
* use a combination of words and images -- dual coding -- to encode the question because it's easier to retrieve from memory
* You can use an image as the question
* Use colors and rich text formatting to make the text more memorable
* use humor, narrative and personal examples to make flashcards more interesting
* create flashcards for the most important facts that represent the core material you'll be expected to know (don't make cards for unimportant things)
* create flashcards for both directions
* use screengrabs (screenshots) liberally
* break it down into its component parts and test your comprehension
* use tags to organize your recalls (sessions) and library items
* append a metacognitive question to the end of the answer
* use cloze deletion questions
* Open-ended questions are more challenging than cloze deletion type or multiple-choice questions.
* use flashcards answers as an opportunity to build associations with other parts of your knowledge base
* craft why questions - deeper level of knowledge of understanding
  * what is cancer (shallow) vs why does cancer exist in nature (deeper)
* create multiple flashcards for the same concept that examine it from different viewpoints
* use mnemonic devices
  * acronyms
  * rhymes too
  * memory palace, especially for enumerations

Practice Process

* make a solid effort to retrieve the answer from memory first (retrieval practice, duh)
  * if unsuccessful, admit that you don't recall the answer
* tag each course and use additional tags for different topics within a subject
  * use interleaving to enhance the power of practice
* use spaced-repetition and manual study
* respond out loud - talk to yourself to promote metacognition
* edit cards during practice to fix errors, add new learning and highlight areas of struggle
* go back to source content to refresh your memory if you struggle with an answer
* study in new contexts - time and location
* practice before you sleep to take advantage of sleep's memory consolidation powers
* break up practice sessions into several pieces to make them less tedious

10:45 time for a break and to see if Byron and I connect today.

11:09 nothing from Byron. I want to find a study partner and/or group.

11:54 solved the `how_big_is_the_room.js` exercise without glancing at the solution. Woot Woot. Used PEDAC. This is fun.

12:00 lunch break then look at the LS solution and other solutions.

12:46 back after lunch.looking at my trello board at the moment.

14:40 making slow progress and sharpening my use of PEDAC.

16:09 finished `tip_calculator.js` and see different ways to write the solution. much to learn young padawan. much to learn.

16:42 I took a break and did some Anki cards. I also got a snack. I'm a little tired.

19:08 started `sum_or_product.js`

08:02 time for family breakfast

09:00 Planning and scheduling this morning. Next study Anki cards for an hour and then take JS101 Lesson 1 Quiz 1.

10:01 Studied 22 Anki cards in 4.56 minutes today (12.43s/card). This doesn't account for the many other minutes editing cards as I studied.

10:49 Took a break and did Nerf Wars with SungOh and drawing with Omi. I enjoyed playing with my kids. Ready to start Quiz 1.

12:20 Okay, take a deep breath. I got 6/9 on the first quiz. Made some careless mistakes thinking I was sure of the answer. Understand the questions!

13:38 After making fried rice with Omi and eating it together. I still need to sit sometimes.

14:48 Finished Sprint 1 Review. Working on Sprint 1 Retrospective.

15:27 Finished Sprint 2 Planning session. Now I need to make cards in Trello for Sprint 2. I enjoy this.

15:58 Watching Mandy Cheang's video

[Use what you know: A journey into metacognition ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bWY8zSMFOo)

Summary

* Metacognition can deepen learning
* Understand what you need from your study tools
* Typora is a markdown editor
* Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program
* Retrieval practice helps with retaining information
* It's OK to not know what you need at first
* Learning how to learn is a process

18:15 Finished Lesson 2 Assignments 1-4. Going to eat dinner. Quiche that Sohee made. Yum.

18:57 Back at my office work station, but my legs feel tired.I think this retina display monitor is better though.

19:46 Finished `calculator.js` following the video. Up for children's bedtime now.

### VS Code Git Status Colors

* Change a line and it goes blue.
* Add a new line and it goes green.
* Do either of these and your file turns yellow in the Explorer.
* Commit and all the colours disappear again.

21:00 Finished coding the `calculator.js` app again using the text instead of the video this time. Getting off now to watch TV with Sohee. Good night for now. I enjoyed today.

09:08 Studied 8 cards, but edited each one. Back from breakfast and ready to get to the next assignment.

09:38 write out the code blocks myself instead of just copying them!

10:04 Trying to disable extensions that code complete or suggest, but can't figure it out.

10:22 I think I found and disabled the extensions that I want to disable, but I will restart now.

12:37 Back from anniversary brunch and dunkin' donuts. ready to program more.

13:24 Finished Flowchart Assignment.

13:47 submitted `multiply.js` solution.

14:00 study session with Laurent

15:14 Did two exercises with Laurent. I have things to learn.

17:35 I went down a wormhole because I can't get ESLint to work in Node. I'm going to let it go and make dinner. I have a linter for VS Code.

18:35 Back after preparing and making dinner. Dictation works in VS Code or VSC.

18:52 Giving up on getting ESLint to work in Node. I keep getting the error

```js

19:31 Worked through the `exclusive_or.js` exercise again by sketching in pencil the values as they get evaluated and change. It helped me to understand what is happening better.

20:18 I still can't get ESLint to work on either machine. Ugh.

21:16 Done for tonight with `calculator.js` version 2 via video walkthrough.

## 20210720 Tuesday

08:39 Getting started after soccer and family breakfast. Got the ESLint issue on my mind. I want to get it working. But I need to time-box it to 30 minutes.

   * I can't get ESLint to work in my environment because of `Error: Failed to load parser 'babel-eslint' declared in '../../../.eslintrc.yml': Cannot find module 'babel-eslint'`

09:17 Figured it out by reading the documentation. I needed to use an earlier version of ESLint and babel-eslint.

### Install `babel-eslint`

Ensure that you have substituted the correct version lock for `eslint` and `babel-eslint` into this command:

```sh
npm install eslint eslint-cli babel-eslint --save-dev
```

Use these version in my environment. Do I also need to install eslint-cli? What about using it as a VSC extension?

```sh
$ npm install eslint@4.x babel-eslint@8 --save-dev
# or
$ yarn add eslint@4.x babel-eslint@8 -D
```

09:49 Took a poop break. I'm going to read a little from *Mastery* before I do a few Anki cards. I also finished listening to LS Podcast S2E2

10:33 Studied 8 Anki cards.

12:07 Finished `calculator.js` second time via the book.

12:28 Back after lunch and ordering Misfits Market box. They're website has good UX and UI.

12:56 ESLint Assignment was short and completed.

13:31 Working on Debugging Assignment and going to move to office workstation.

14:19 Finished the Debugging Assignment. It's cool. So many tools and features to programming. I love it.

15:03 Finished Errors Assignment.

16:00 Finished Preventing Errors Assignment.

17:59 Finished 13. Preventing Errors, 14. Catching Errors, 15. Precedence, and 16. Assignment: Calculator Bonus Features part 1.

19:42 Added configuration file to `calculator.js` at `calculator_messages.json`. This is fun and cool.

20:59 16. Assignment: Calculator Bonus Features 2/3 completed. Still working on Internationalization.

21:59 Final commit for tonight. Watching NBA finals game 6 and going to bed to sleep before early study session with Alex tomorrow morning.

08:06 breakfast delayed to 8:30. Start Anki cards now.

08:36 Studied 11 cards in 1.88 minutes today (10.24s/card) with 30 minutes total of editing them.

09:18 Read Eamon O'Callaghan [JS109]'s article.

09:33 Back at the standing desk work station.

10:00 Working on Explicit Type Coercion assignment.

10:34 Emailed resume draft to Christine at NJDOL for our meeting tomorrow.

11:33 Got an interview with Encora for a TPM position. I have to research it.

12:21 Scheduled interview with Encora. I need to research the company.

12:33 Finished Explicit Type Coercion.

13:02 Working on Implicit Type Coercion. Really enjoying this.

13:17 taking a break to play ping pong

13:33 Not playing ping pong because Louis has his sister over at his house.

13:34 [35+ Mac Text-Editing Keyboard Shortcuts to Speed Up Typing](https://www.howtogeek.com/681662/35-mac-text-editing-keyboard-shortcuts-to-speed-up-typing/)

Moving the Cursor

You can use the arrow keys to move the cursor around and press Enter to start a new paragraph. Using the Option and Command keys as modifiers, you can move the cursor in the following ways:

* Option+Left Arrow: To the beginning of the previous word.
* Option+Right Arrow: To the beginning of the next word.
* Command+Left Arrow: To the beginning of the current line.
* Command+Right Arrow: To the end of the current line.
* Option+Up Arrow: To the beginning of the current paragraph.
* Option+Down Arrow: To the end of current paragraph.
* Shift+Enter: Starts a new line in apps like Messages, Slack, or WYSIWYG editors.

13:59 Back to work.

14:30 took a short nap.

14:39 Implicit Type Coercion assignment complete.

16:25 Did Odd Lists exercise with Laurent after he looked at my code for `calculator.js`.

16:36 I'm shutting down my office work station after making all my commits. Going to check email and messages and then review the Small Problems I did today with Alex and Laurent. I'm not sure about playing soccer tomorrow morning as my hamstring still feels tight.

19:27 I can't get ESLint to work properly in VSC. Not sure what's going on. It's a project unto itself as is Git.

19:51 Time to put the kids to bed and return to this later.

21:18 playing around with ESLint and I think I fixed it. I commented out the #parser and ignoreComments: true

```yml
3 #parser: babel/eslint-parser

61      ignoreComments: true
```

I think this means I can use the latest ESLint version.

21:52 I tried to uninstall ESLint globally, but I still have two versions and I can't seem to figure out how to get rid of them.

   * Remember [On Pace and Productivity](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/07/21/on-pace-and-productivity/)

09:22 Trying to settle down. I will read *Mastery* a bit after I poo and before I do some Anki cards.

09:38 Read a section of *Mastery* in the practice chapter. Ready to do some Anki cards.

10:01 Studied 8 cards in 1.46 minutes today (10.92s/card). I edited all 8 cards.

10:27 Chatting with Saro about Dr. Riotto. Going to push a commit here and then go to the office workstation. I will do the Walk-through: Calculator assignment again to practice before starting the Mortgage Calculator. This is still fun and interesting and challenging and what I want to be doing.

11:45 Did resume review with Christine Denning and scheduled an interview prep for Monday. Listening to music is great. I cleaned up the office and it feels good to be in here.

11:50 Ready to practice the Assignment: Calculator.

13:14 So much to learn about Node, NPM, ESLint, config files. ESLint is not reading my `.eslintrc.yml` file. Eyes are strained and my legs are tired. I am going to the dining room table now.

13:56 I notice that my mind is much sharper since I have been programming every day. I really want everything in my life to be organized well and so I am running algorithms on everything from the way that my wallet is organized to my external environment. This is so much fun to do all of this.

14:14 I finished Walk-through: Refactoring Calculator assignment with `calculator_practice.js`.

14:26 The Launch School curriculum is definitely the slow path to proficiency. I have spent the day going back through the Calculator assignment to do it again.

14:41 Good tips from Jordan Whistler

* `npm list`
* `npm ls -g` to see if it's installed globally
* `npm uninstall eslint -g`
* put the `yaml` file in the root folder there.

14:54 Now I have a different problem in that it seems I don't have NPM installed and working. Ugh.

16:12 After study session with Laurent. He figured it out completely differently than the LS solution. Bravo.

20:18 My last note was over four hours ago? I'm slipping. I had went for a short bike ride with SungOh, had dinner, did some more coding, picked up Omi and Claudia from MacKenzie Redmond's birthday party at Graydon, put the kids to bed and am back.

20:35 Coding Tips assignment completed.

20:42 Slow and steady today. I understand the calculator assignment much better now. I like learning new material. I need to enjoy the small problems exercises too. Taking a break to watch 'Never Have I Ever' with Sohee.

22:26 Watched two episodes of Never Have I Ever. Installed Firefox Developer Edition on both machines and my phone. It's faster than Safari and Chrome.

23:07 I have to go to sleep. I have a study session with Alex tomorrow at 6:00.

## 20210723 Friday

07:09 Did study session with Alex, but ended abruptly when SungOh woke up. We'll meet again on Sunday.

INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING: The Basics: Exercise

Use the arithmetic operators to determine the individual digits of a 4-digit number like 4936:

1. thousands place is 4
2. hundreds place is 9
3. tens place is 3
4. ones place is 6

```js
let number = 4936;

let ones = number % 10;
console.log(ones); // => 6

number = (number - ones) / 10;
console.log(number); // => 493

let tens = number % 10;
console.log(tens) // => 3

number = (number - tens) / 10;
console.log(number); // => 49

let hundreds = number % 10;
console.log(hundreds); // => 9

let thousands = (number - hundreds) / 10;
console.log(thousands); // => 4 */
```

10:32 Back from Dr. Riotto's with a healing hamstring. Working on Lesson 2 Assignment 21 on Variable Scope in the backyard. The cicadas are loud.

12:13 After study session with Mandy.

15:22 Tired. Took a short nap. Played ping pong with Louis. We were tied at 4-4 and then he won four straight. Ugh.

17:13 Finished Variable Scope Assignment.

17:15 Take some time to read Pro Git.

17:37 Markdown coloring looks wrong and I can't use font features.

18:22 Markdown was using babel-eslint. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off, so I just copied the `journal.md` file to `journal_20210723.md` file.

21:19 Done for now at the end of "Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value" assignment. I need to re-read "Variables as Pointers" tomorrow.

09:11 Tired after soccer. My hamstring is still not near 100%. Maybe I should see Dr. Riotto multiple times next week.

10:23 My Anki cards need improvement. I'm tired right now. I think I'm going to read the Coding Tips 2 assignment and then take a nap. We'll see. Also I want to read another chapter of *Mastery*.

10:32 So many great articles about using tools to program.

[How Markdown Helps Me Take Better, Faster Notes](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2018/01/13/markdown-note-taking/)

* VS Code features available through the Command-Palette (`cmd` + `shift` + `P`).

[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

    * ![emoji-rendered](emoji-rendered.png)
* [Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)

11:24 Just took a dump. I'm tired and my body feels sore. I want to take a nap. Okay, read *Mastery* chapter now.

11:47. I was writing in the wrong file. I hope this works. I am now writing in the right file.

11:51 Good job H. I got rid of the older `journal_20210723.md file`

11:52 I read the next chapter in *Mastery*. I like using Markdown in VS Code.

12:39 Fixed the `undefined` errors in my calculator assignment to add the config file. This is fun!

13:41 Back after prepping lunch and eating family lunch. I'm working on the internationalization of the calculator assignment. It's fun. I made a Korean, ko version.

14:35 I need to create some conditional logic to change the output to Korean, but I'm not sure how to do it as I get a TypeError:

```sh
/Users/hyosung11/Launch-School/Courses/JS101/Lesson-2-Small-Programs/calculator_practice.js:153
  if (LANGUAGE = 'ko') {
               ^

TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

I need to create a function that sets the language for the entire program. Not hard code it like I am doing now.

15:40 Took a short nap. I'm still tired. My eyes feel strained. Eye divergence exercises needed.

17:36 needed a nap and a break. ready to make dinner. i'll be back after dinner.

18:52 back after dinner. I ate too much and am 90% full instead of stopping at 80% full.

21:12 Working through Coding Tips 2. Taking a break to watch Ted Lasso with Sohee.

### [Vim Basics in 8 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggSyF1SVFr4)

Vim dumps you into command mode to start

* `:q` to quit Vim
* `w` writes to the file
* `:wq` to write and quit
* `q!` quit without saving changes
* `I` - `INSERT` mode
* `esc` switches back to command mode
* `set number` turns on line numbering
* `dd` deletes a line

08:23 Added Vim basic commands notes. Next time I have a Git problem, handle it better.

08:43 Feeling resistance to doing the Anki cards. Why? Do them while note taking? That doesn't make sense. I think it's read and take notes and then make cards, but that's not what the doctor recommends.

10:02 Worked on Anki cards. Slow and steady progress.

10:34 Took a break to play Nerf adventure with SungOh. It was fun. Now back to Lesson 2 > 25. Coding Tips 2

11:38 I'm tired again and my eyes feel strained as well as my right forearm. I switched my track pad to the left. Use dictation more? Am I just fueled by caffeine and I don't have any today so I don't feel as peppy? That's not true I actually did have one cup of coffee this morning.

11:49 I finished the "Gain experience through struggling" section of Coding Tips 2.

13:42 I'm tired but more energized after lunch. I'm ready to do Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Planning. I still haven't gone back to the Assignment: Mortgage / Car Loan Calculator. I did start listening to *A Mind for Numbers* by Barbara Oakley as an audiobook.

15:50 Finished Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, and Sprint Planning. The Sprint Planning went faster than last week. Time for a break.

16:35 Taking a break after starting the Walk-through Rock, Paper, Scissors assignment.

16:55 Finished Walk-through Rock Paper Scissors video version.

## 20210726 Monday

   * I feel really tired this morning.

07:54 My right hamstring still feels strained. I'm tired. My eyes are tired. Maybe I need to walk to the cemetary for memento mori? Or some ping pong?
08:52 After breakfast with the kids and telling a story using Nerf Guns as characters to engage SungOh. That was fun.

09:20 Checked email efficiently and took some notes on the right kind of coffee to drink as suggested by T-Nation. I miss training heavy at the gym. Going to start Anki cards now. I don't want a job right now as I want to devote my time and energy to studying the Launch School core curriculum. This reminds me that I want to check when certification for UI benefits is scheduled for me this week.

09:27 I still need to figure out how to make keyboard shortcuts in VS Code.

09:59 I studied 7 cards today. Edited each one as I went.

12:31 Finished helpful Interview Prep session with Christine Denning. I still don't want the job or any job right now. I'll work on the 'Walk-through: Rock Paper Scissors' text version after ping pong with Louis. I might do some more Anki cards right now.

14:25 Finally got 'Stringy Strings' solution to work. Little things that I need to pay attention to better.

14:35 Reviewed the LS solution to 'Stringy Strings'. I'm hungry now. Time to grab a snack.

14:56 Before study session with Laurent.

15:32 Going through Mochi cards that Laurent made. The six falsy values are 0FUNN'' - 0, false,undefined, NaN, Null and empty string. The red highlighting stopped.

16:19 Back from break pulling weeds in the backyard and got bit multiple times by mosquitoes. Ugh.

17:02 Good to take the breaks today. I opened up the Productivity Planner and think I will use it going forward despite doing the Daily Scrum Questions. Taking a break to make dinner now. I'll return to the rest of the Rock Paper Scissors assignment after dinner.

19:27 Back at my office workstation after dinner and cleanup. SungOh was sick and threw up but he feels better now. I completed the Concussion in Sports and emailed my completion certificate to Keith at BCSOA. Now trying to integrate the Productivity Planner into my work.

19:38 Wrote work items for tomorrow in the Productivity Planner. Going up to get ready for bed with the kids. Making a journal commit now. I might work more on Rock Paper Scissors after putting the kids to bed and before watching TV with Sohee.

20:46 Added features to Rock Paper Scissors through the video version. I'll do the text version later. Time to watch some TV with Sohee.

## 20210727 화요일

06:37 Awake and reading. I didn't play soccer this morning because I want to heal my hamstring. Alex declined to meet, so I have some free time this morning to read and write and do some work before my interview at 10:30. All is well.

06:59 *Mastery*: liberation comes through the acceptance of limits (129).

07:11 Need to do physical training everyday. My hamstring still feels strained. Dr. Riotto tomorrow?

07:44 I'm still reading *Learn Like a Pro* first chapter. Have a *ready-to-resume* plan before engaging a distraction.

07:57 Study between 6 ~ 8 hours per day in addition to classes. More than 8 hours per day doesn't improve grades. *Learn Like a Pro*, 9. What's the proper citation method? Don't listen to music, including binaural beats. It slows down learning.

09:11 After family breakfast and playing outside with SungOh.

   2. Remember to take breaks and practice the fundamental human movements!

11:18 Back to Launch School after the screening interview with Elias at Encora. I think it went well. I have made it to the next round. I need to research Agile/Scrum before the next interview. What is this resistance to doing the Mortgage Calculator assignment?

11:47 Okay, I started the Mortgage Calculator assignment. Now getting ready for the Algorithm Writing Clinic.

13:03 That was informative and showed my path to proficiency.

15:02 Back from ping pong and picking up Omi from Graydon.

17:40 After study session with Laurent. I need to spend some solo time working on exercises to train my problem-solving skills. Omi's warm but okay.

19:16 After delicious dinner that Sohee made of chicken fajitas. My eyes are tired. I will do some Anki cards now.

19:46 Did 5 Anki cards. Slow and steady.

20:21 Working on the text version of RPS assignment.

21:01 Finished refactoring the Rock Paper Scissors assignment.

21:23 Cleaned up spelling mistakes and unknown words.

## 20210728 수요일

07:20 After study session with Alex. I need to rep each problem multiple times. Even if I know the algorithm, I don't know the method or methods to use in JavaScript syntax. So much more to learn.

09:32 [Super Memory](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)

11:05 Got my mortgage calculator working with almost 100% copying of the LS solution. Baby steps. Step by step. Progress not perfection. Ready for a longer break.

11:49 Made Anki cards from the questions at the end of the Mortgage Calculator assignment.

13:59 Was AFK for ping pong where I got slaughtered today by Louis and then ate lunch and took a cold shower. My right elbow feels irritated even though I changed my trackpad to the left side. I feel tired and am going to take a nap.

14:38 Took a short nap and read *Kettlebell Simple & Sinister*.

14:55 I read through the RPS Bonus Features and watched the Big Bang Theory clip. I have to pee and take a five minute power break.

16:45 Made Anki cards from JS101 > JavaScript Basics > Reading Documentation 1. Good good good. I have to pee and then go outside for a few minutes before making dinner.

21:18 Made Anki cards from JS100 - JavaScript Basics > Reading Documentation 2

21:20 Start with JS100 - JavaScript Basics > Loops > Loop and Log tomorrow.

## 20210729 목요일

06:17 I bought and am reading Kettlebell Simple & Sinister Revised and Updated. Birds chirping loudly.

06:20 Something unpleasant is going on with my skin. It's bumpy and oozing and then crusting. Is it a mild case of shingles? I'm just guessing. Oh, I had another screening interview yesterday and will have a second interview with them next week. The company is called Triveni, I think.

08:21 Did the full KSS and feel great afterwards. I even did the stretches and the hanging from a pullup bar. Now time to enjoy some Omar hazelnut coffee and read before family breakfast.

08:33 read *Mastery* chapter. Now family breakfast.

09:21 Getting to Daily Scrum questions a little later today.

11:28 Finished *Mastery*. I skimmed the part about breathing and energy and ki. No ping pong with Louis. I want to practice soccer drills in my cleats and maybe even outside later during my siesta. I have a partial mind to move to my laptop now. Not sure that I will.

11:06 At the dining room table doing correspondence right now.

11:32 Tired today at the moment. I took a break for correspondence. Now listening to Pure Focus on Apple Music, but it has lyrics which is not good for studying.

08:17 At the dining room table cleaning up my git commits from my two different machines. Read a little before breakfast and then do my daily scrum. Okay.

11:31 Working with my Anki cards. Now time for a break to train.

3. Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?
   * My morning plan is to prep for my interview and have an interview prep meeting with my career coach. So I won't have as much time to study Launch School.

09:20 Kids are still here. I can't seem to focus right now. I planned to do KSS, but I feel delayed at the moment.

09:36 Vacillating at the moment. Not sure whether to continue studying or do KSS now. I postponed KSS until siesta time, so I can do more Launch School now. Go!

10:06 Reviewed a bunch of Anki cards and deleted most of the cards I made before because they aren't in the form of a question. Now shifting gears to prep for interview prep.

12:13 Finished prep for interview prep and interview prep with Christine. Ready to KSS!

13:04 Finished KSS in 46:00 including stretching. Ready for my siesta including some food after a quick cold shower.

14:06 Back to studying Strings.

14:57 Time for a break. Getting better and better, little by little.

17:18 Unproductive in the afternoon. I got coffee, gas for the car, and worked on my referee schedule for the fall.

20:19 Tired. Eyes tired. I started watching Beginner Git Tips. Going to couch and MBP now.

20:39 Working on Strings. It's fun. I can do this.

21:35 Finished Strings while watching the Olympics. Not great. Lack focus. Need to work on Capitalized Words tomorrow.

## 20210803 화요일

06:48 I can't decide what I want to do first this morning after meditation and a morning page in my journal.

07:10 Worked on capitalize words and making mistakes that I learn from, like forgetting to call the method `.toUpperCase` by forgetting the parentheses.

08:08 Read two chapters of *Learn Like a Pro*.

08:18 more practice with capitalize words

08:27 Another repetition on capitalize words and I'm better with it.

09:08 UI benefits certification website is down. Ugh.

   * I sometimes have a false sense of knowing something and then when I code it out, I realize that there are gaps in my knowledge. I just need to keep practicing and honing the procedural system.

09:42 So good to get those repetitions in to groove the procedural process.

10:55 Working on Arrays because I like it.

14:05 Finished KSS. It took a little longer and I got into a little tiff with SungOh because he wouldn't close and lock the front door after Damon arrived. I need to stay calm and not dismiss him like I did.

14:18 I apologized to SungOh for being short with him. I practiced the "Vocabulary" exercise form Arrays. I got it now, I think.

14:24 Ready to take a quick shower.

14:43 Body still itches from the poison ivy. Ugh.

16:01 So tired right now. I need a nap or a walk. Go for a walk now.

17:18 Finished with Arrays!

17:40 Read chapter of *The Pragmatic Programmer*.

## 20210804 수요잏

06:01 Waiting for Alex. I'm tired and could go back to bed. The birds chirp loudly.

07:22 Wrapping up study session with Alex.

08:02 Decided to wait to do KSS until after my interview. Started reading *Learn Like a Pro* chapter on testing, but decided to read it later. Now reading *A Mind for Numbers*.

08:33 My stomach itches so much. It feels good instantaneously to itch. Why? I added some hydrocortisone, but I have calamine lotion on my brain.

09:16 I have to pee.

09:50 Where did the time go? I got dressed up with a button down shirt and pants and I took a poo. I did check email, Slack, Messages, and WhatsApp.

10:46 Feeling antsy before the interview. I want to get it over with at this point. Ugh. I think I want to go to the gym today, maybe?

12:08 Interview is over and I think it went well. Vishwas had such a poker face, it was hard to tell how my answers landed.

14:13 After a walk, food and nap. Ready to study some more. I'm still itching even though I rubbed some Topicort and hydrocortisone on itchy body parts. Ugh.

14:51 Able to work pretty quickly through Greet 1, 2 and 3. Chalk came for the kettlebells which SungOh ripped open and spilled onto the couch. I'm tired but trying out chalk gives me a little motivation to train after my study session with Laurent.

16:11 Did two exercises with Laurent where he was driving the entire way and I was trying to keep up with his work. Good to watch him work.

16:13 Time to do KSS with chalk today!

16:33 Now going to do KSS.

16:43 I feel more invigorated to train now. Hmm.

17:22 Finished KSS and it feels good to read while stretching.

20:18 After putting the kids to bed. I feel itchy and have put on calamine lotion. It's all over my body and my clothes.

## 20210805 목요일

08:18 I feel tired this morning. I slept until around 7:30, two hours later than usual. Things are simmering in my brain. My body still itches from the poison ivy. What about my massage? When to take the quiz. Behind? I thought the Encora interview went well for me yesterday. We shall see. All is well.

08:51 After family breakfast, I'm at the dining room table about to read *Learn Like a Pro*.

   * Overall, feeling tired and lower energy lately. I haven't played soccer this week because of my hamstring, so not getting enough exercise.

10:00 Practiced 'Calculate Cat Age' exercise. It took around 20 minutes. Taking a short break and then coming back for the next exercise. I need more calamine lotion on my legs and arms.

10:23 Practiced 'Remove Last Char' exercise. I understand `String.prototype.substring()`.

10:32 Now I can just laugh when I encounter something that I don't know how to do in programming and then let the anxiety wash away before trying some shit.

10:53 Finished Function 2 a little early!

11:45 Back to programming after a break for email and some videos. I still itch in my abdomen area. Ugh.

11:55 Able to practice and complete 'Retrieve a Value (Part 1)' in ten minutes.

12:52 Working through Objects now.

13:03 Family is eating lunch, so I will take a break and sit with them.

13:52 In my siesta time, I checked email and have another interview with the CEO of Encora on Monday. It looks good for getting the job. Just about ready for KSS.

14:57 Finished KSS in 39:07 because I took shorter rests and also didn't do QL straddle which I don't like because it's painful and I want a better alternative. I'm going to shower now. My face is itching again. Ugh. Read some from the *Pragmatic Programmer* while stretching. They say learn a new language and start reading a new book after this one.

15:21 Rinsed off and put the Tecnu? stuff all over and buzzed my hair a little. Feel itchy in a few spots. Ugh.

15:51 Humming along through the Objects exercises in JavaScript Basics. I've got three more to do, but the study session starts soon.

17:27 Playing with the code after the code after the study session. I need to learn the different array methods.

19:01 After dinner, vacuuming and listening to the latest Launch School podcast episode.

19:39 Practiced "Convert an object to a nested array" using `Object.entries()`.

19:52 Late to putting the kids to bed. I still mildly itch in a few spots.

09:21 Ready to review JS101 Lesson 2.

11:04 Taking a break for correspondence. I'm going to sit outside and see if the fuzebug gadget works.

11:08 I think the fuzebug is a dud. I sat outside and the mosquito had no interest in the fuzebug. Ugh.

11:26 Taking a pee break and then back to studying before I train.

11:32 Still itchy all over.

13:15 Studied JS101 Lesson 2 into implicit type coercion. Taking a break to train in soccer skills and KSS.

13:32 Finished 10 Minute Ball Mastery Workout. Itchy on my belly right now. What is the resistance to training with kettlebells? Body doesn't want to do the work? My belly has gotten bigger without weekday soccer and I've gained weight. Ugh.

14:21 I feel so much better after training in soccer and with kettlebells. Now I'm going to eat something and then take a cold bath. I might do a little more studying before I go to see Dr. Riotto for some treatment on my hamstring. Yippee!
