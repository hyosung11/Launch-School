# Launch School Mastery Based Learning Journey Journal

Started the Prep courses and finished on Sunday, 20210711.
Wrote and sent Assessment email on 20210711
Accepted and enrolled on Monday, 20210712

## 20210712 월요일

Still trying to figure out how best to use Anki cards.
What about agile/scrum development processes to go through the core curriculum?
accountability
daily standup meeting?
work in sprints?
user stories
study group?
LS Slack channel and community
cleaned up the office a little bit
a little tired and scattered at the moment. i had trouble sleeping last night as my mind felt excited to get to work. that's a good sign. this does feel like play to me. i'm having fun and enjoying myself

what type of role and in what kind of company do I want to work?
look at LS95 again

tired today. skipped the first quiz. I want to make my anki cards for the Prep courses and do at least one small problems set

[Six Rules for Good Git Hygiene](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2)

Always `pull` before a `push`.
`pull` frequently.
`push` frequently.
Commit frequently.

* Commit small, single changes with carefully crafted commit messages that tell what the small, discrete change is.
* If you need to use the word 'and', you are not committing enough.

Merge `forward` frequently.
Create `pull requests` infrequently.

Anki cards
Daily Scrum
study buddy
spent a lot of time reviewing the anki cards I made yesterday. I want to make more cards today before I do problems and take the quiz

14:28 still reviewing the Introduction to Programming book and making Anki cards. This is beneficial.

16:12 More review. God, I need to work on the problems instead of just looking at the answer.

17:55 I think reviewing the fundamentals will pay off later.

20:33 Finished Anki cards on arrays.

   1. I'm good right now

09:36 - pretty much finished Anki card review. I think 100 cards is too much for one review.\
09:50 - doing more cards, but am going to take a break for ten minutes and start working on exercises.\
10:10 - added speed focus mode to anki cards and finished 100 cards.

Use a`\` to create a line break.

[Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/markdown-basics?id=line-numbers)

line-numbers
You can enable line number for a code block by adding line-numbers class.

```javascript {.line-numbers} {highlight=2}
aa
bb
cc
```

* this doesn't show up in GitHub

13:36 - reviewing my notes and code from the Intro to PEDAC study session. Time to take a break and go outside.

15:28 I looked at the PEDAC problem again. I need to train in coding cleanly over and over again.

17:22 worked through some JavaScript Basics exercises. Time to make dinner. I wonder if I should disable some of these extensions?

19:52 made dinner, went for bike ride with SungOh and did Easy 1 > Isn't it Odd? exercise. It was fun to figure out by researching the `Math.abs()` function

21:52 submitted odd_numbers.js solution and looked at the other solutions.

22:10 submitted even_numbers.js solution which was super similar to odd_numbers.js

22:31 started How Big is the room with setup of readline-sync, but going to sleep now.

23:08 Jordan Whistler demonstrated Live Share for VS Code wtih me.

## 20210715 목요일

09:00 I asked Byron to do a daily scrum/standup at 11:00. We'll see if he responds. I also asked Alex to do a study session tomorrow morning.

09:05 Study Tips from Mandy Cheang (TA)  09:00 => check `mandy_cheang_study_tips.md`

## Mandy Cheang Study Tips from Slack Message

Good morning!
My best tips would probably be:

* mindset, have a growth mindset
* be kind and patient to yourself, take breaks and rest when you need. Your brain also is working in the backend when you're resting. (diffuse mode)
* be self aware, iterate through your process of learning, get feedback, and ask structure questions when you don't understand. So "I tried this and that, my mental model is currently is this. But I don't know what is happening when the output is X, when I expect it to be Y."
* active recall, flash cards, teaching, but have some way to evaluate yourself or something else to evaluate you
* mistakes are opportunities
* try to make as MANY mistakes as you can and figure out the gaps in your knowledge before the assessment / interview
* I use to "highlight and re-read" all the time, it's not effective.
* I do take notes but I take notes in question form and convert them to anki flash cards
* If you are struggling, don't try to tackle everything at once, break it down to the pieces and tackle each piece incrementally. Then everything will come together as a whole. Ex. You can't solve a coding problem within 20 minutes. It's not very effective if you keep coding with other students without working on yourself and the individual pieces your struggling with. In order to get faster, practice being familiar at the methods you can use, be rock solid on loops and iterations, then practice breaking down the problem, practice the algorithm. These are all pieces you can practice individually and be aware which pieces your struggling with and try to tackle that. It's like weight-lifting or playing a sport. If you want to have a strong full body or your training for a sport, you work on biceps for a while, then you work on legs, then everything comes together as a whole.
* Don't worry about learning how to study, it's not a detriment of actually studying. I spent months iterating and learning more on how to learn. It pays dividends and your efforts will compound overtime. Learning how to learn effectively has been the best investment in my life.
* Ok that was a lot. I have more resources for you if you're interested in taking a look. These things have helped me:
* One last great tip is, study with others. If you haven't already, check out the #the-spot you can find a lot of other students on the same course, same path.

[How to Create and Practice Flashcards Like a Boss](https://medium.com/@iDoRecall/https-medium-com-idorecall-how-to-create-and-practice-flashcards-like-a-boss-b7efb5a53293)

* flashcards are utilized for building easy recall of the things that you’ve already learned.
* Create your flashcards while consuming your learning content. (When I use the word content, I’m referring to the academic materials that you can read, watch or listen to.)
* read things only once.
* The only active approach is to _practice retrieving what you learn from memory_.
* Read once and create flashcards as you work your way through the material:
  * capture all the concepts and facts you want to remember
  * Once you have processed that piece of learning content, meaning once you have read it in its entirety and created the necessary flashcards, mark it as completed.
  * Then use the flashcards and retrieval practice as your primary tools for remembering the key concepts and facts forever.
* When you create a flashcard, draft the question and answer from memory.
* On every flashcard, ask only one question and whenever possible, only one answer.
* the most challenging flashcards are the ones where you have to retrieve a large collection of items from memory.
* keep the question concise but make it just long enough to be explicit and clear
* carefully craft your question to elicit the best and most complete answer
  * think like a trial attorney who is examining a witness
* it's better for a question to be longer than the answer
* keep answers short, simple and specific to stimulate synpatic strengthening.
* use a combination of words and images -- dual coding -- to encode the question because it's easier to retrieve from memory
* You can use an image as the question
* Use colors and rich text formatting to make the text more memorable
* use humor, narrative and personal examples to make flashcards more interesting
* create flashcards for the most important facts that represent the core material you'll be expected to know (don't make cards for unimportant things)
* create flashcards for both directions
* use screengrabs (screenshots) liberally
* break it down into its component parts and test your comprehension
* use tags to organize your recalls (sessions) and library items
* append a metacognitive question to the end of the answer
* use cloze deletion questions
* Open-ended questions are more challenging than cloze deletion type or multiple-choice questions.
* use flashcards answers as an opportunity to build associations with other parts of your knowledgebase
* craft why questions - deeper level of knowledge of understanding
  * what is cancer (shallow) vs why does cancer exist in nature (deeper)
* create multiple flashcards for the same concept that examine it from different viewpoints
* use mnemonic devices
  * acronyms
  * rhymes too
  * memory palace, especially for enumerations

Practice Process

* make a solid effort to retrieve the answer from memory first (retrieval practice, duh)
  * if unsuccessful, admit that you don't recall the answer
* tag each course and use additional tags for different topics within a subject
  * use interleaving to enhance the power of practice
* use spaced-repetition and manual study
* respond out loud - talk to yourself to promote metacognition
* edit cards during practice to fix errors, add new learning and highlight areas of struggle
* go back to source content to refresh your memory if you struggle with an answer
* study in new contexts - time and location
* practice before you sleep to take advantage of sleep's memory consolidation powers
* break up practice sessions into several pieces to make them less tedious

10:45 time for a break and to see if Byron and I connect today.

11:09 nothing from Byron. I want to find a study partner and/or group.

11:54 solved the `how_big_is_the_room.js` exercise without glancing at the solution. Woot Woot. Used PEDAC. This is fun.

12:00 lunch break then look at the LS solution and other solutions.

12:46 back after lunch.looking at my trello board at the moment.

14:40 making slow progress and sharpening my use of PEDAC.

16:09 finished `tip_calculator.js` and see different ways to write the solution. much to learn young padawan. much to learn.

16:42 I took a break and did some Anki cards. I also got a snack. I'm a little tired.

19:08 started `sum_or_product.js`

08:02 time for family breakfast

09:00 Planning and scheduling this morning. Next study Anki cards for an hour and then take JS101 Lesson 1 Quiz 1.

10:01 Studied 22 Anki cards in 4.56 minutes today (12.43s/card). This doesn't account for the many other minutes editing cards as I studied.

10:49 Took a break and did Nerf Wars with SungOh and drawing with Omi. I enjoyed playing with my kids. Ready to start Quiz 1.

12:20 Okay, take a deep breath. I got 6/9 on the first quiz. Made some careless mistakes thinking I was sure of the answer. Understand the questions!

13:38 After making fried rice with Omi and eating it together. I still need to sit sometimes.

14:48 Finished Sprint 1 Review. Working on Sprint 1 Retrospective.

15:27 Finished Sprint 2 Planning session. Now I need to make cards in Trello for Sprint 2. I enjoy this.

15:58 Watching Mandy Cheang's video

[Use what you know: A journey into metacognition ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bWY8zSMFOo)

Summary

* Metacognition can deepen learning
* Understand what you need from your study tools
* Typora is a markdown editor
* Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program
* Retrieval practice helps with retaining information
* It's OK to not know what you need at first
* Learning how to learn is a process

18:15 Finished Lesson 2 Assignments 1-4. Going to eat dinner. Quiche that Sohee made. Yum.

18:57 Back at my office work station, but my legs feel tired.I think this retina display monitor is better though.

19:46 Finished `calculator.js` following the video. Up for children's bedtime now.

### VS Code Git Status Colors

* Change a line and it goes blue.
* Add a new line and it goes green.
* Do either of these and your file turns yellow in the Explorer.
* Commit and all the colours disappear again.

21:00 Finished coding the `calculator.js` app again using the text instead of the video this time. Getting off now to watch TV with Sohee. Good night for now. I enjoyed today.

09:08 Studied 8 cards, but edited each one. Back from breakfast and ready to get to the next assignement.

09:38 write out the code blocks myself instead of just copying them!

10:04 Trying to disable extensios that code complete or suggest, but can't figure it out.

10:22 I think I found and disabled the extensions that I want to disable, but I will restart now.

12:37 Back from anniversary brunch and dunkin' donuts. ready to program more.

13:24 Finished Flowchart Assignment.

13:47 submitted `multiply.js` solution.

14:00 study session with Laurent

15:14 Did two exercises with Laurent. I have things to learn.

17:35 I went down a wormhole because I can't get ESLint to work in Node. I'm going to let it go and make dinner. I have a linter for VS Code.

18:35 Back after preparing and making dinner. Dictation works in VS Code or VSC.

18:52 Giving up on getting ESLint to work in Node. I keep getting the error

```js

19:31 Worked through the `exclusive_or.js` exercise again by sketching in pencil the values as they get evaluated and change. It helped me to understand what is happening better.

20:18 I still can't get ESLint to work on either machine. Ugh.

21:16 Done for tonight with `calculator.js` version 2 via video walkthrough.

## 20210720 Tuesday

08:39 Getting started after soccer and family breakfast. Got the ESLint issue on my mind. I want to get it working. But I need to time-box it to 30 minutes.

   * I can't get ESLint to work in my environment because of `Error: Failed to load parser 'babel-eslint' declared in '../../../.eslintrc.yml': Cannot find module 'babel-eslint'`

09:17 Figured it out by reading the documentation. I needed to use an earlier version of ESLint and babel-eslint.

### Install `babel-eslint`

Ensure that you have substituted the correct version lock for `eslint` and `babel-eslint` into this command:

```sh
npm install eslint eslint-cli babel-eslint --save-dev
```

Use these version in my environment. Do I also need to install eslint-cli? What about using it as a VSC extension?

```sh
$ npm install eslint@4.x babel-eslint@8 --save-dev
# or
$ yarn add eslint@4.x babel-eslint@8 -D
```

09:49 Took a poop break. I'm going to read a little from *Mastery* before I do a few Anki cards. I also finished listening to LS Podcast S2E2

10:33 Studied 8 Anki cards.

12:07 Finished `calculator.js` second time via the book.

12:28 Back after lunch and ordering Misfits Market box. They're website has good UX and UI.

12:56 ESLint Assignment was short and completed.

13:31 Working on Debugging Assignment and going to move to office workstation.

14:19 Finished the Debugging Assignment. It's cool. So many tools and features to programming. I love it.

15:03 Finished Errors Assignment.

16:00 Finished Preventing Errors Assignment.

17:59 Finished 13. Preventing Errors, 14. Catching Errors, 15. Precedence, and 16. Assignment: Calculator Bonus Features part 1.

19:42 Added configuration file to `calculator.js` at `calculator_messages.json`. This is fun and cool.

20:59 16. Assignment: Calculator Bonus Features 2/3 completed. Still working on Internationalization.

21:59 Final commit for tonight. Watching NBA finals game 6 and going to bed to sleep before early study session with Alex tomorrow morning.
