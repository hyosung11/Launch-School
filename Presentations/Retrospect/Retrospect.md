# Capstone Project Presentation: Retrospect | Aug 17, 2021 12:00 PM

Retrospect is an observability tool that allows you to record back-end activity in an easily searchable manner, replacing the process of pinging servers and searching logs. It also records front-end activity, giving the user an exact reproduction of the customer UI. Finally, Retrospect ties the front-end recordings to the back-end recordings in a single UI.
