tension between doing the right thing and making money

increase load in capstone and can we continue to hit placement and salary numbers as the cohorts get larger

Capstone Projects

Mothership
Spaceship
Spacecraft

Streaming

the better you get the more leverage you have to dictate what industry you go into
get good and do whatever you want to do

Curriculum

What's on the test?
What's the destination -> to get to Capstone -> engineering specific jobs of a product

Taxonomy of different software jobs

Feedback from Chris because he's on your side.

Communication Skills

- banter
- build rapport in a few minutes
- confidence

Stellar Students

- take ambiguity and bring order to it
- don't need specific instructions
- understand the goal behind the specifications
- lot of personal effort to persevere and take ambiguity
- carry yourself in a professional setting
- good communicator
- organize work -> fast track to promotion

more than half of the work is non-technical
communication in a project setting, e.g., status reports

Employers use "experience" as a way to say they want someone who can work independently and collaboratively.

Impostor Syndrome
not knowing fundamentals well
comes from thinking you should be something that you are not

I'll learn about it and we can talk later

Web 3.0

blockchain technology is interesting

core curriculum is battle-tested
