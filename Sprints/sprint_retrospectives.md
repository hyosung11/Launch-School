# Sprint Retrospectives

## Sprint 1, 20210712 - 20210718

1. **What went well?**
In other words, what took place that we want to recognise and acknowledge as having gone well?

- I studied consistently everyday.
- I reached out to other students for study sessions and support
- deconstructed and applied the PEDAC problem solving process to my exercises
- iterated on my study habits to improve my pedagogy
- slowed down to recognize that I need to pace myself to gain mastery

1. **What didn’t go so well?**
What took place that didn’t go as we would have liked?

- felt frustrated that I didn't do better on my first quiz
- doing anki cards can get tedious
- still struggling to get correct JavaScript syntax when coding
- look at the solution too quickly when struggling

1. **What did I learn?**
We want to think about what we’ve learned about how we worked together. It’s less about the content and more about the process.

- did a lot of work, but concerned about consistency and sustainability moving forward
- good to have study buddies
- I am good at reaching out and organizing study sessions

1. **What still puzzles me?**
This question allows us to capture things that happened but leave us feeling unclear or puzzled.

- can't seem to get syntax
- think I understand something and then when I try to code it out, I get lost and can't remember what to do next.
