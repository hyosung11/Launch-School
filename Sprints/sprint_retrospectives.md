# Sprint Retrospectives

## Sprint 1, 20210712 - 20210718

1. **What went well?**\
In other words, what took place that we want to recognise and acknowledge as having gone well?

   - I studied consistently everyday.
   - I reached out to other students for study sessions and support
   - deconstructed and applied the PEDAC problem solving process to my exercises
   - iterated on my study habits to improve my pedagogy
   - slowed down to recognize that I need to pace myself to gain mastery

2. **What didn’t go so well?**\
  What took place that didn’t go as we would have liked?

   - felt frustrated that I didn't do better on my first quiz
   - doing anki cards can get tedious
   - still struggling to get correct JavaScript syntax when coding
   - look at the solution too quickly when struggling

3. **What did I learn?**\
We want to think about what we’ve learned about how we worked together. It’s less about the content and more about the process.

   - did a lot of work, but concerned about consistency and sustainability moving forward
   - good to have study buddies
   - I am good at reaching out and organizing study sessions

4. **What still puzzles me?**\
This question allows us to capture things that happened but leave us feeling unclear or puzzled.

   - can't seem to get syntax
   - think I understand something and then when I try to code it out, I get lost and can't remember what to do next.

## Sprint 2, 20210719 - 20210725

1. **What went well?**\
In other words, what took place that we want to recognise and acknowledge as having gone well?

   - Studied everyday using a logical process that I'm fine-tuning as I go along
   - Tweaking my notetaking process to challenge myself to recall more as I read
   - Disciplining myself to write out the code examples in the assignments instead of just copying and pasting them into my notes
   - Listened to Launch School podcasts for information and inspiration everyday

1. **What didn’t go so well?**\
  What took place that didn’t go as we would have liked?

   - some anxiety about what seems to be slower than expected progress
   - still gaps in my problem-solving process as demonstrated in the algorithm I presented at the JS101 Study Session
   - resistance to doing the Assignments in Lesson 2

1. **What did I learn?**\
We want to think about what we’ve learned about how we worked together. It’s less about the content and more about the process.

   - I don't eat the frog first
   - Taking active breaks to move my body and use kettlebells makes a difference to my energy and concentration levels
   - What about listening to music while studying?

1. **What still puzzles me?**\
This question allows us to capture things that happened but leave us feeling unclear or puzzled.

   - I'm not sure how deep I need to go with understanding:
     - e.g., researching `Number(value)` and it has so much material on MDN
   - I still make syntactic mistakes and get lost as I code out the algorithms as to what I'm doing in a particular step

## Sprint 3, 20210726 - 20210801

1. **What went well?**\

   - Tweaking my note-taking process to challenge myself to recall more as I read
   - Disciplining myself to write out the code examples in the assignments instead of just copying and pasting them into my notes
   - Making Anki question cards from the JS100 - JavaScript Basics exercises
   - Reading and watching learning to learn materials
     - *Learn Like a Pro* book
     - *Learn Like a Pro* edx course
     - *A Mind for Numbers* Audible book

1. **What didn’t go so well?**\
  What took place that didn’t go as we would have liked?

   - Caught poison ivy, so feeling itchy and irritated by that
   - I still don't fully understand every piece of code that I write. I need to test my code and see exactly what's happening step by step
   - Fear of failing Lesson 2 Quiz 1

1. **What did I learn?**\
We want to think about what we’ve learned about how we worked together. It’s less about the content and more about the process.

   - I need to break down Trello cards into smaller tasks that can be more easily tracked
   - Using the Pomodoro technique is effective to ward off fatigue and keep me energized to continue
   - Starting Kettlebell Simple & Sinister makes my body feel fit for study

1. **What still puzzles me?**\
This question allows us to capture things that happened but leave us feeling unclear or puzzled.

   - I don't do enough repetitions
   - Practice, practice, practice, practice
   - Take advantage of the procedural system as it will pay off later

   - Learning to shift between focused and diffuse modes better


1. **What didn’t go so well?**\
  What took place that didn’t go as we would have liked?

   - progress still feels slow
   - can do more active recall

1. **What did I learn?**\
We want to think about what we’ve learned about how we worked together. It’s less about the content and more about the process.

   - Breaking down tasks into atomic units so I can track my progress and complete items in Trello gives me pleasure
   - Using the standing office workstation facilitates more productivity
   - I want to create a better barrier between the office and the living room, so I can concentrate more when studying
   - Continue to do Kettlebell Simple & Sinister after studying makes more sense for me lately

1. **What didn’t go so well?**\
  What took place that didn’t go as we would have liked?

   - Incorporate more resilience and learn to enjoy the challenge of being confused and use that to activate neuroplasticity through the release of norepinephrine and dopamine
   - Do more active recall!

1. **What did I learn?**\
We want to think about what we’ve learned about how we worked together. It’s less about the content and more about the process.

   - Use my hormonal system to my advantage - like checking things off to get the greens in Trello

This question allows us to capture things that happened but leave us feeling unclear or puzzled.

   - Not sure how to incorporate Anki cards into studying
   - Should I write out exercises by hand?
   - Keep doing more repetitions and really learn from mistakes as that's the way our nervous systems learn
