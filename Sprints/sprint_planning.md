# Sprint Planning Questions

## Sprint 2, 20210719 - 20210725

Sprint planning meetings should involve setting expectations, reviewing the backlog, and covering upcoming tasks for the sprint. During this meeting, teams should highlight any potential roadblocks that may occur and halt progress.

Fulfill those goals with the following questions:

* What did we learn at sprint review and sprint retrospective that needs to be considered in our planning conversations today?
  * I need more repetitions with syntax while coding.
  * It's good to have lots of study session as they time-box doing exercises.
  * Make better Anki cards at the inception to avoid having to edit them later.
  * This is fun and continues to be fun.

* What is at the top of the product backlog?
  * JS101 Lesson 2
  * Small Problems
  * Review JavaScript Basics

* What do we need to know about these backlog items in order to fully commit to getting them done in the upcoming sprint?
  * How much content is in JS101 Lesson 2?
  * At last week's pace doing two Small Problems a day on average, especially with a study buddy seems doable.

* How much of the product backlog do we think we can complete in the upcoming sprint?
  * JS101 Lesson 2
  * 14 Small Problems
  * Anki cards through JS101 Lesson 2

* Do we need more clarification on this feature?
  * No

* What is our confidence level regarding this (sprint backlog) as a reasonable plan for this sprint?
  * High confidence level
  * Since focusing on learning to learn in the last sprint, this sprint should provide more time to study and do exercises.

* How is this yet-to-build backlog item similar/relative to other known/completed work we have done in the past? How does this comparison help us estimate the relative size of the new work?
  * Having done JS100 and JS101 Lesson 1, I think completing JS101 Lesson 2 and getting into JS101 Lesson 3 should be possible.

* What outside help will we need to succeed with our plans?
  * Study sessions with Alex and Laurent
  * Daily Scrum Meetings with Byron
  * Launch School Study Sessions
  * LS Slack communication

* What’s the biggest risk that may prevent us from completing this sprint?
  * Body limitations of stiffness and soreness if I don't take breaks, go for walks, strength train, play soccer.
  * Not getting a foldable barstool for office work station

* Who is taking time off during the next sprint? How should we plan differently given the team’s (adjusted) capacity?
  * Nobody
