# Practice Questions from Jonathan, Sergio and Elaine

## 3. Object Properties

The code logs `{name: 'Jane', age: 24, Jessie: 'Jessie'}` and returns`{ name: 'Jane', age: 24, Jessie: 'Jessie' }`. This example illustrates accessing and changing object properties. On line 1, the global variable `person` is declared and initialized to reference the object `{name: 'Jane', age: 24}`. On line 6, the function `changeName` is declared with the parameter `name`. On line 12, the function `changeName` is called with the string `'Jessie'` passed as an argument. Within function `changeName`, bracket notation is used to create a new key/value pair `{Jessie: 'Jessie'}` within the object `person`. On line 8, the `console.log` method passes in `person` as an argument and logs the mutated `person` object. The same object is returned on line 9.

## Variables as Pointers

The code logs `{ account: 1234, company: 'IBM', ceo: 'Arvind Krishna', salary: '1.5 million'}` and `{ account: 1234, company: 'IBM', ceo: 'Arvind Krishna', salary: '1.5 million'}`. This example illustrates variables as pointers. On line 1, the global variable `data` is declared and initialized to reference the object `{ account: 1234, company: "IBM" }`. On line 2, the global variable `newData` is declared and initialized to reference the same object that the variable `data` references. On lines 3 and 4, dot notation is used to create two new key/value pairs for the object referenced by `newData`. At this point the two variables `data` and `newData` point to the same object, mutating the shared object will result in the change being reflected in both variables. Thus when the `console.log` methods are called on the last two lines with the variables `data` and `newData` passed as arguments respectively, the same object is logged.
