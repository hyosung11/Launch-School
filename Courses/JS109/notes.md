## 1. Lessons: Assessment JS109: JavaScript and General Programming

## Assignment 1. Assessment Format

This assessment is in 2 parts:

1. a timed test that you can start whenever you are ready.
2. a 1-on-1 live coding interview using Zoom or Skype.

Not passing either part results in a "Not Yet" for this assessment. See the [Assessment Rules](https://launchschool.com/gists/99b650e4) for the policy on retakes.

### Part 1 - Test

Part 1 - Test

The test constitutes part 1 of this assessment. It contains a series of questions (around 20), and you will have **3 hours** to complete it. After you submit the test, it will be graded within 24 hours. After the initial grading, you might be asked to revise your answers, even if you receive a high grade. After you submit acceptable revisions, the grader will send the test to the instructor for a final evaluation. The instructor will take a look at your initial answers and revised answers, and determine whether the work is sufficient to pass. The instructor will make a final evaluation within 24 hours of receiving the test from the grader. The entire process could take a few days, depending on how well you do on the initial answers and how quickly you respond to requests for revisions.

If you pass, you can continue on to part 2. If you don't pass, you must retake this test again according to the retake policy.

There will be a study guide for the test that walks you through exactly what to study for and how to prepare.

### Part 2 - Interview

Once you pass part 1, you'll receive instructions on scheduling a follow-up interview.

The interview will be conducted like a real job interview, except we'll only talk about topics covered in this course. Make sure that you're clear on the core concepts from the lessons, and that you're able to explain clearly with code examples during the interview. You'll be expected to describe concepts with precision and clarity, while at the same time providing code examples.

We'll conduct the interview using Zoom or Skype, along with a collaborative online editor. We'll primarily use [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/). You should practice using the CoderPad environment ahead of time by exploring the [demo pad](https://app.coderpad.io/JEYFF66M). This pad is set up for demonstration purposes only and will not be used for the actual interview. When you're done exploring the demo pad, make sure that you clear any changes you made so that it's ready for the next person to use.

There will be a study guide for the interview that walks you through exactly what to study for and how to prepare.

## 2. Study Sessions

If you haven't already, we highly encourage you to attend a study session and/or to create one of your own to further practice your skills. Details about both kinds can be found [in this assignment](https://launchschool.com/lessons/c5707865/assignments/832cfd62). Again, it is not mandatory, but we believe it will benefit you greatly.

As you start to focus on the first assessments, our official Assessment Prep study sessions can form a useful part of your preparation. We highly recommend that you attend at least one formal JS109 study group which can be found on the Events and Forum pages. These are a great way to get a better understanding of what will be expected of you on the assessments.

### Practicing with Other Students

Choosing to do additional practice with other students is a great way to improve your ability to communicate effectively and code well under pressure. Below are some suggestions on possible ways you could structure these study sessions.

#### Written Assessment

Several students have found it helpful to send short code snippets back and forth. Student A will send Student B a code snippet. Then, Student B will time herself explaining the output and return values of that code snippet and giving an explanation for each. After completing all of the received problems, Student B will send it back to Student A where Student A can now read her answers and give feedback.

This helps both students better see their own strengths and weaknesses, how long it takes them to write out their answers, and removes some of the stress of novelty that the first written assessment may bring.

#### Interview Assessment

The first interview assessment can be daunting because of its format: you must solve coding problems in front of someone else and without any documentation or notes. Thus, the best way to prepare for this kind of assessment is to recreate the format in your practice.

A good way to do this is for you to pair up with another student. Each of you can choose a JavaScript Small Problem that you have already solved (and preferably your partner has not). Then, on a live call, you have to solve a problem in front of them, and they have to solve a problem in front of you. In addition to solving the problem well and without too much assistance, it's good to practice talking through and explaining your code as your solving the problem. This communication during the interview assessment is essential.

Although some students look to external resources outside of Launch School curriculum to search for practice problems, we recommend using the Launch School JS101 - Small Problems in the first instance. Those in the Medium problem sets in particular are good preparation for the level of difficulty of the problems you will encounter during the interview. If you are thinking of using an external resource such CodeWars, we suggest that you first read [this article](https://medium.com/launch-school/the-pros-cons-of-codewars-for-ls-assessments-36167a8141cf), by one of our students, outlining the pros and cons of using CodeWars in this context (the article refers to the RB109 assessment, but is equally applicable to JS109).
