first question was simple
- reversing the order of a string and keeping nonletters in same order

second problem
- count the occurrences of letters that appear more than 3x in a string and return them
- if at least more than 2 letters then return in an array
- if single letter return letter
- if `invalid` return null

finished in 35 minutes
didn't get stuck

console.log in my iterations

feeling nervous before
- went on a jog before to stay calm

short and easy explanations for both problems

communicated well
explained PEDAC

no feedback

didn't run into any trouble

stuck with algorithm
reviewed test cases

ask what is the expected output

Typoglycemia
Scramble

console.log during iterations
use node to test things

being in control
