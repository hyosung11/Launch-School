/* JS100/101 Study Session: PEDAC - More Advanced Problems

Introductions
- Michael: Italy, get some more practice with the PEDAC
- Wendy Tran: Oregon, thinking through problems with PEDAC
- Daniel Ebron: NYC, JS101, started section on PEDAC
- Spencer: Colorado, JS109, preparing for written assessment
- H: learn to adjust algorithm to the problem

Ask the interviewer about parts of the problem that you don't understand.

//Understand the Problem

// Given two arrays, return whether the two arrays are opposites of each other.
// That means both arrays are comprised only from elements a and b and the occurrences
// of these elements are swapped between the two arrays.

// All tests will include only two different elements.
