# [Quiz Guide](https://launchschool.com/gists/9376eab7)

Quizzes are auto-graded checkpoints that test your knowledge of the current lesson. Its goal is to allow you to check your understanding of the topics in the current lesson without any consequences attached to your performance. It is solely for your own benefit.

Given this, please take note of the following when working through a quiz:

* You will get a grade, but it won't be used to assess you in a formal capacity.
* Quizzes are *open book*. Feel free to use the course materials to find answers.
* Quizzes are not timed. Do not rush through answering a question. Take as much time as you need to work through quizzes. Many quiz questions are very nuanced and contain subtle, but important, **edge cases to consider**.
* There are no partial points, since everything in quizzes is auto-graded.
* **Low scores are common on many quizzes. Try not to feel demoralized if you get a low score.**
* **Try to understand why you missed specific questions and use that analysis to firm up your mastery of the material.**
* Quizzes focus on the topics covered in the current lesson. However, *some questions may cover topics from an earlier lesson or from the reading material*.
* Quizzes are blocking. You have to take them to get to the next assignment/lesson.

## F.A.Q.

Can I retake quizzes?

Yes and no. Your first attempt at a quiz is the one that gets **recorded permanently**, so you can't change the score. However, *you can review the questions* on the quiz as a self-test: simply click the Hide Your Answers button to hide the previous results.

What happens if I score low on quizzes?

Officially, nothing will happen. It doesn't affect your progress in the Launch School curriculum. Consistent low scores, however, may imply that you must review some materials more carefully.

Does a low score mean I'm doing poorly?

No. The quizzes are difficult and sometimes tricky. Furthermore, each question is either right or wrong with no partial credit. Combined, these features make low scores commonplace for all students. What matters is not your score, but *how you deal with the missed answers*. Use the missed answers to solidify your mastery of the related concepts.

Where can I view my quiz scores?

You can view your quiz scores from `My Assessments > Quizzes` from the side navigation.

What if I think a quiz answer is wrong or ambiguous?

Please submit feedback together with the supporting reason why you think the answer is wrong. We will work quickly to correct it.

Is it ok to talk about quizzes in Slack? Or in the lesson discussion?

Yes, though it is recommended that you talk about it in the *lesson discussion*. It gives everyone a chance to see the discussion, and also more room to warn others that there are possible "spoilers" in the post as compared to Slack.

Are my answers saved if I accidentally exit the browser while taking a quiz?

The answers you've clicked "saved" on are stored. You can go back to the quiz by going to `My Assessments > Quizzes`. On the quizzes tab, you'll find the quiz you haven't finished to have a status of "Awaiting Answers." This is similar to how real assessment exams work.

Can I skip quizzes?

No, you can't. You must complete the quiz before you can proceed to the next assignment/lesson.
