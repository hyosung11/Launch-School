# Lesson 5: Advanced JavaScript Collections

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we took an in-depth look at JavaScript collections. You should now feel comfortable with what collections are on a conceptual level, as well as with working with them on a practical level, through looping and using iterative methods. If any of those areas still feel unclear, it would be a good idea to review them again before moving on.

In this lesson, we will be building on what we learned in the previous lesson and exploring some more advanced aspects of working with collections in JavaScript such as sorting, nested collections and working with callback functions.

Before you start, make sure to create a new directory for this lesson. Call it perhaps `lesson_5`, and do all your work for this lesson in that directory.

```sh
js_101          <-- this is your course 1 git repo
|
+--lesson_2     <-- all lesson 2 code goes here
|
+--lesson_3     <-- all lesson 3 code goes here
|
+--lesson_4     <-- all lesson 4 code goes here
|
+--lesson_5     <-- all lesson 5 code goes here
```
