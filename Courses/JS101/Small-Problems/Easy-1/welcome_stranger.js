Welcome Stranger

Create a function that takes 2 arguments, an array and an object. The array 
will contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, 
will produce a person's name. The object will contain two keys, "title" and 
"occupation", and the appropriate values. Your function should return a 
greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title.
