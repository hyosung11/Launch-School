# Courses > JS101 Programming Foundations with JavaScript > Lesson 4: JavaScript Collections > 1. Introduction

## 1. Introduction

Programming involves working with data. It's common for programmers to store, search and manipulate data as part of their day-to-day work. Think about that first action for a moment: storing. How do we store data? The answer for most programming languages is to put them into structured containers, or collections. Collections come in many different forms, and it's useful to think of them as lists of data.

In this lesson, we'll work with three of the most commonly used collections in JavaScript: String, Array, and Object. String values in JavaScript generally aren't regarded as collections since strings are a primitive data type, but they do exhibit some properties of collections; for example, you can extract a character or a substring from a larger string. That is why we'll cover them here with the other collections.

You have already encountered these collections in previous lessons and assignments; in this lesson, we will explore them in greater depth.

Before you start, make sure to create a new directory for this lesson. Call it perhaps lesson_4, and do all your work in this lesson in that directory.

```sh
js_101          <-- this is your course 1 git repo
|
+--lesson_2     <-- all lesson 2 code goes here
|
+--lesson_3     <-- all lesson 3 code goes here
|
+--lesson_4     <-- all lesson 4 code goes here
```

## 2. Collections Basics

Collections are made up of individual elements. To work with collections, we need to understand how they are structured and how to reference and assign the individual elements within them.

### Element Reference

#### String Element Reference

![]

#### Array Element Reference

#### Object Element Reference

#### Element Reference Gotchas

##### Out of Bounds Indices

##### Invalid Object Keys

##### Arrays are Objects!

### Conversion

### Element Assignment

#### Object Key Assignment

#### String Character Assignment

### Summary

We've talked about quite a few important topics in this assignment. More specifically, we covered the core ways to reference elements or assign values for particular elements in a collection using some of the various element reference and element assignment methods of String, Array, and Object.

These concepts are fundamental to working with collections, so it's critical to understand everything we talked about in this assignment before moving forward. Taking the time to have a clear understanding of these topics will make it much easier to handle topics that build upon these fundamentals in the future.
