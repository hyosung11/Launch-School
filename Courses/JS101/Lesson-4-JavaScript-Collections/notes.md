# Courses > JS101 Programming Foundations with JavaScript > Lesson 4: JavaScript Collections > 1. Introduction

## Introduction

Programming involves working with data. It's common for programmers to store, search and manipulate data as part of their day-to-day work. Think about that first action for a moment: storing. How do we store data? The answer for most programming languages is to put them into structured containers, or collections. Collections come in many different forms, and it's useful to think of them as lists of data.

In this lesson, we'll work with three of the most commonly used collections in JavaScript: String, Array, and Object. String values in JavaScript generally aren't regarded as collections since strings are a primitive data type, but they do exhibit some properties of collections; for example, you can extract a character or a substring from a larger string. That is why we'll cover them here with the other collections.

You have already encountered these collections in previous lessons and assignments; in this lesson, we will explore them in greater depth.

Before you start, make sure to create a new directory for this lesson. Call it perhaps lesson_4, and do all your work in this lesson in that directory.

```sh
js_101          <-- this is your course 1 git repo

+--lesson_2     <-- all lesson 2 code goes here
|
+--lesson_3     <-- all lesson 3 code goes here

+--lesson_4     <-- all lesson 4 code goes here
```
