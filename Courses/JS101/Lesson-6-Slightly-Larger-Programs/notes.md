# Lesson 6: Slightly Larger Programs

## 1. Introduction

In this lesson, we'll work on some slightly more complicated programs. These programs will be a departure from the simple ones you've seen so far; they are also beyond what you need for the JS109 assessment. However, they will challenge you to put everything you've learned to use and provide good practice for working with more extensive programs.

For the best results, take the following approach:

* Break down each problem into smaller pieces. Decomposition of the problem is probably the most challenging and most important task since you first have to understand the problem well. Your first attempt may not lead to a good solution, so don't be afraid to start over.

* Map the flow of the program in a flowchart, using sub-processes to encapsulate distinct components of the problem.

* When you're ready to tackle a component or sub-process, write the pseudocode for that sub-process. The pseudocode will probably translate into one or more functions, so be sure you understand what your inputs and outputs will be.

* Play around with the code. **Write every line of code and make sure you understand it.** Don't use copy and paste.

* *Do the assignments in sequence.* We'll walk you through the necessary steps to break down the problem.

* Don't be afraid to read the walk-throughs. Use them as guard rails so that you don't get stuck and spin your wheels for too long. However, don't sit back and read them without typing or coding along, either.

Before you start, make sure that you create a new directory for lesson 6. Call it something like lesson_6, and do all your work for this lesson in that directory.

Your working directory should now look something like this:

```sh
work            <-- this is your course 1 git repo
|
+--lesson_2     <-- all lesson 2 code goes here
|
+--lesson_3     <-- all lesson 3 code goes here
|
+--lesson_4     <-- all lesson 4 code goes here
|
+--lesson_5     <-- all lesson 5 code goes here
|
+--lesson_6     <-- all lesson 6 code goes here
```

## 2. More Node Debugger Commands

Earlier in the course we introduced some debugging techniques, including the basics of using the built-in Node.js debugger. As programs get larger and grow in complexity, the likelihood of bugs occurring in your code increases. When dealing with larger programs it is even more important to know how to identify and eliminate bugs when they occur. Before continuing with this lesson we recommend that you review [this assignment](https://launchschool.com/lessons/64655364/assignments/3b953f14).

In that earlier assignment, we listed some of the debugger's commands and outlined their basic usage. The debugger provides some additional functionality, some of which can be especially useful when working with larger or more complex programs. This functionality is described in the [Node documentation](https://launchschool.com/lessons/64655364/assignments/3b953f14). In this assignment, we'll explain and demonstrate some of it.
