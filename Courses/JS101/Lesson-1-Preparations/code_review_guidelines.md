# Code Review Guidelines

Upon completing a course project, you may request a code review in the lesson's discussion forum. Code reviews are a great way to receive valuable feedback and improve your code. In our experience, students who request code reviews do better on assessments and in future courses. Utilize the value of code reviews.

## Guidelines

* Many projects have an optional **bonus features** assignment that you are encouraged to implement. You may choose to request a code review either before or after completing the bonus features portion of a project. However, **we can only support one code review per project**. To get the most out of a project, request a code review on the bonus features assignment.

* Sometimes students ask us to look at code again after making corrections or updates following the initial code review. While that's ok, we can't do another full code review. Instead, we'll just take a quick look at the areas we discussed in the first evaluation.

* Submit one code review request at a time. Code reviews are more beneficial when you can use the result to improve each project. If you submit multiple reviews at once, you're likely to see the same things brought up in each review.

* We cannot perform code reviews on non-Launch School material. We also can't do code reviews on code that isn't part of a Launch School assignment in one of the course lessons. In particular, the exercises on Exercises tab or exercises for optional content are not reviewable. Those activities are for you to gain more practice.

* **Language Check** requests: we cannot do language checks. Language checks typically happen when a student is preparing for one of the earliest assessments. They may ask us to verify whether they're correctly describing code or concepts. Unfortunately, we cannot review these as that would be akin to grading an essay before you submit it.

## Tips for Success

* If you are struggling to debug some code or understand a concept, don't wait until you request a code review of your whole project to ask for help. Go ahead and create a post for that issue in the lesson forum. That lets us focus on your question and address it specifically. It also helps other students with the same question find your post.

* Asking good questions is essential to mastery-based learning; good questions should be specific. If you are having trouble with some code, include a link to the GitHub repository or gist where we can look at the full program. Identify the issue with as much precision as possible; provide details about how you have tested the problem already.

* Reading code is an important skill. Feel free to spend time reading through other code reviews in the lesson forums.

* Before requesting a code review, be sure that your program runs without error and is as close to a _final product_ as possible. That helps our staff give you focused and useful feedback.

## JavaScript Specific Tips

If you are using JavaScript, be sure to use Node, your browser console, or the browser's inspector, as well as the [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to debug and test programming concepts.

Don't forget to run your code through ESLint and do your best to address any complaints.

## Ruby Specific Tips

If you are using Ruby, be sure to use Pry, IRB, and the Ruby documentation to debug and test programming concepts.

Don't forget to run your code through Rubocop and do your best to address any complaints.
