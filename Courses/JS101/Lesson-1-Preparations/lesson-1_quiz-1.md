# Lesson 1 Quiz 1 (Are you sure?)

You're about to take the first quiz in the Core Curriculum. Almost every lesson in Core concludes with one or two quizzes. Before you take one, take some time to look over our [Quiz Guide](https://launchschool.com/gists/9376eab7).

Pay particular attention to the fact that the quizzes are **difficult**, and that low scores are commonplace. Don't let a low score leave you feeling frustrated or demoralized. The quizzes are intended to *highlight concepts that you might need to review*, but they are not used in any way to evaluate your performance. Use the questions you missed to focus your attention on topics where you might need a bit more study.

Please read this [quiz guide](https://launchschool.com/gists/9376eab7) before starting the quiz. It gives you an idea of what quizzes are and how to use them.

Assignment: Lesson 1 Quiz 1
Student Name: HyoSung Bidol-Lee
Time Started: 10:56AM EDT

A number of the questions in this quiz depend on the information you learned about in [Introduction to Programming with JavaScript book](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript).

## Question 1

What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Your Answer
Git is a distributed version control system which was designed to be used locally without a main central repository. GitHub is a cloud-based remote repository which acts as a centralized repository for Git to enable collaboration.

## Question 2

When should you nest Git repositories?

Your Answer
You should not nest Git repositories.

## Question 3

Which of the following should you do as part of an *active learning approach* to using the video resources at Launch School?

Your Answer

- Take notes.
- Eliminate external distractions.
- Look up concepts you don't understand.
- Review your notes to make sure you captured the key concepts.

## Question 4

When asking for help, what might be considered a *bad* question?

Your Answer
A question that you can easily test.

## Question 5

Which of the following are built-in JavaScript data types?

JavaScript has seven built-in data types:

1. `null`
2. `undefined`
3. `boolean`
4. `number`
5. `string`
6. `object`
7. `symbol`

`Integer` and `Float` **are not** built-in JavaScript data types.

Identify data types by the `typeof` operator. Variables don't have types, but the values in them do. These types define the intrinsic behavior of the values.

## Question 6

Select the statement about JS's **primitive values** that are correct:

- `undefined` is a *primitive value*
- You **can't** *mutate* a *primitive value* after creating it.

- ~~Primitive values are mutuable.~~
- ~~`NaN` is a primitive value.~~

## Question 7

Which of the following statements are **true** about the following code snippet?

```js
let myNumber = 3;
```

The code snippet contains:

- only a *statement*
~~- only an *expression*
- both a *statement* and an *expression*
- neither a *statement* or nor an *expression*~~

**Statement**: a unit of code representing one instruction or more, usually starts with a language reserved keyword and ends, *explicitly* or *implicitly*, with a **statement terminator**. Examples of statements:

```js
> 3;
> let x = 3;
> if () {}
> for () {}
> while () {}
```

**Expression**: a unit of code that resolves to a value, as instance, **literals** & **operators**. Examples for expressions:

```js
> 3
> 1 + 2
> "expression"
> fn()
> []
> {}
```

## Question 8

Which of the following choices are **true** about the following code snippet?

```js
let myVariable = 'Hello, World';
myVariable = 23;
```

Your Answer

- [ ] The last line produces an error since `myVariable` already references a `string`. Once you create a variable, you can't assign a different type to that variable.

- [x] The two `myVariables` are different. One stores a `string`, the other a `number`.

- [x] This code works. Once you can create a variable, you can reassign it to a different value.

- [ ] All of the above are **false**.


## Question 9

Which of the following statements about the `==` (loose equality / non-strict equality) operator are true?

Your Answer

- [x] When comparing a `number` and a `string`, JavaScript coerces the `string` to a `number`.

- [ ] When comparing a `number` and a `string`, JavaScript coerces the `string` to a `number` if it's on the left-hand side; it doesn't if it's on the right.

- [ ] When comparing a `number` and a `string`, JavaScript coerces the `string` to a `number` if it's value is numeric (i.e., 1 or 1.0).

- [ ] When comparing a `number` and a `string`, JavaScript coerces the `number` to a `string` and then performs a lexicographic (natural alphabetic) comparison.
