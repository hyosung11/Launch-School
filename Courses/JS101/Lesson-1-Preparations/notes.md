# Lesson 1: Preparations Notes

## Welcome

### Discussions vs General Forums

Each lesson has a separate [discussions](https://launchschool.com/lessons/c5707865/home) forum.
General Forums

### How to ask for feedback

* The most efficient way to get good feedback or help is to treat questions to the forums as questions you'd ask a co-worker. 
* Lead with the error message, or describe in detail how the error happens. 
* Outline the steps you've taken so far to address the problem, and offer your guess as to where the problem lies. 
* Paste a link to your code - this is probably your GitHub repository. 
* Try to paste the exact file, so people don't have to hunt through your repo.
* If the error output is long, don't paste the entire thing into the forums. Use a [Gist](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) or Pastebin and include the link. 
* By describing what debugging steps you've already taken and where you think the problem is, you'll direct their efforts in the right path.
* Use rubber duck debugging - outline your problem when asking for help. This well help clarify the problem and may also help you resolve the issue by yourself.

### GitHub Repository

All of your code for our courses should be pushed to GitHub repositories. For this course, you can use one repository, but create a separate folder for each lesson. When asking for help, make sure you push the code from your local machine to your GitHub repository. Without your code, there's little anybody can do to help you.

### Helping Each Other

One of the benefits of going through a program like this is the other motivated students who are taking the course with you. We encourage you to get to know each other, by way of helping and pushing each other. We've seen graduates pair off to start their own projects, and refer each other for jobs. After you take this program, you'll have spent a significant amount of time learning with each other, so take time to encourage, motivate, help and learn from each other.

Feel free to ask questions, but go beyond "it doesn't work" or "I'm having issues." Take time to describe what isn't working, what the steps are to reproduce it, and any debugging steps you've already taken, and include a link to the code. Doing so will lead to faster, more helpful responses.
