# Lesson 1: Preparations Notes

## 1. Welcome

### Discussions vs General Forums

Each lesson has a separate [discussions](https://launchschool.com/lessons/c5707865/home) forum.
General Forums

### How to ask for feedback

* The most efficient way to get good feedback or help is to treat questions to the forums as questions you'd ask a co-worker. 
* Lead with the error message, or describe in detail how the error happens. 
* Outline the steps you've taken so far to address the problem, and offer your guess as to where the problem lies. 
* Paste a link to your code - this is probably your GitHub repository. 
* Try to paste the exact file, so people don't have to hunt through your repo.
* If the error output is long, don't paste the entire thing into the forums. Use a [Gist](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) or Pastebin and include the link. 
* By describing what debugging steps you've already taken and where you think the problem is, you'll direct their efforts in the right path.
* Use rubber duck debugging - outline your problem when asking for help. This well help clarify the problem and may also help you resolve the issue by yourself.

### GitHub Repository

All of your code for our courses should be pushed to GitHub repositories. For this course, you can use one repository, but create a separate folder for each lesson. When asking for help, make sure you push the code from your local machine to your GitHub repository. Without your code, there's little anybody can do to help you.

### Helping Each Other

One of the benefits of going through a program like this is the other motivated students who are taking the course with you. We encourage you to get to know each other, by way of helping and pushing each other. We've seen graduates pair off to start their own projects, and refer each other for jobs. After you take this program, you'll have spent a significant amount of time learning with each other, so take time to encourage, motivate, help and learn from each other.

Feel free to ask questions, but go beyond "it doesn't work" or "I'm having issues." Take time to describe what isn't working, what the steps are to reproduce it, and any debugging steps you've already taken, and include a link to the code. Doing so will lead to faster, more helpful responses.

### Submitting Assignments

## 2. Set Up Your Profile Image

* Changed my GitHub Profile picture.
* [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) a 3rd party profile image provider

## 3. Using Markdown

*  [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
*  Make sure that you surround code with backticks (`), not apostrophes ('). 
   *  The backtick character is usually in the top left of your keyboard. 
* Also make sure that you use the Preview functionality to double check that the output looks as you expect, especially if you copy/paste code or console output.

## 4. Finish Prep Course

- [x] finish prep course
- [ ] review prep course

## 5. System Check

- [x] Node.js version 10.0.0 or higher installed.
- [x] v16.4.1

## 6. Differences Between JavaScript Versions

* Be aware that differences exist.
* With new releases of JavaScript, features are sometimes added, deprecated, or removed entirely.
* When using the JavaScript documentation, be sure to check the compatibility charts.

## 7. Git and GitHub

Make sure your GitHub repositories are public so that we can see your code. We'll talk about code hygiene and working with teams much later in the program. For now, please follow these guidelines:

* Make frequent commits to your local repository.
* Push your code to the remote repository often.
* Make sure that you push all your work-in-progress work to the remote repository when asking for help or a code review. It's how we can see your work and help you.
* In this course, it's ok to use a single git repository for all of the assignments. Make sure to create a new directory for each lesson so that we don't have to go hunting through your code.
* Do not create a nested git repository within another git repository. For instance, if you have a git repository in your js_101 directory, don't put another in js_101/tic-tac-toe. It's fine to put multiple small programs in separate directories within the repository, but don't create repositories inside those directories.
* When we move on to web development projects, you should use a separate repository for each project, but that is not a requirement for now. It won't hurt if you do; creating new repositories will help you learn how to use git.
* Much later, we may demonstrate places where you'd want to create a separate git repository to organize code. When you do that, make sure that you don't nest git repositories.

## 8. Active Learning

There are videos in some parts of our program. Some are long while others are short. Don't lean back and relax when watching the videos, especially the long ones. Approach them as you would a lecture in school:

* Make sure there are no external distractions. Turn off the tv and cell phone.
* Take notes.
* Look up concepts that you don't understand.
* Afterward, try to articulate the concepts in your own words. Later, we'll ask you to blog about what you learned to help reinforce this practice.
* Don't browse Facebook, Twitter, and other sites while the video is running.
* Visualize yourself in a classroom. Fabricate some competition with fellow students if it helps you stay motivated.
* Most videos are short, but a few run as much as an hour or more. Try to maintain active listening for the duration.
* Review your notes after the video to make sure you have captured the key concepts.
* This course teaches you programming, but it's also important to learn how to learn, especially when it's been a while since you've been in school.
