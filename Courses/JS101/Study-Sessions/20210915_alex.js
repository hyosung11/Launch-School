/*
map() is called on an array and returns a new array in which each element in the original array is transformed into the return value of the callback function for that element.

forEach() is used to iterate through an array and pass each element to the callback function as a parameter--but crucially, forEach does not use the return value of the callback function and always returns undefined

filter() is called on an array and returns a new array comprised of the elements of the original array for which the callback

some() is called on an array and returns true if the callback function evaluates as true for any of the elements of the original array.

every() is called on an array and returns true if the callback function evaluates as true for all of the elements of the original array.

sort() is called on an array and

find()
push() is called on an array and appends whatever is passed to it as an argument to the end of the array. It returns the new length of that array.

unshift() is called on an array and appends whatever is passed to it as an argument to the beginning of the array. It returns the new length of that array.

Study Guide
- declarations, initialization, assignment, and re-assignment
- variable scope, especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks (variable shadowing)
- primitive values, objects, and type coercions
- object properties
- mutability vs. immutability vs. const
- loose and strict equality
- passing arguments into and return values out of functions
- working with Strings
- working with Arrays, especially the iteration methods (forEach, map, filter, and find)
working with Objects; accessing keys and values of an Object as arrays
arrays are objects
understand the concepts of pass-by-reference and pass-by-value
variables as pointers
console.log vs. return
truthiness vs. boolean
function definition and invocation
function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions
implicit return value of function invocations
first-class functions
side-effects
naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)
be able to explain what a function does without talking about its implementation; that is, document a function's use and purpose. (See below.)
