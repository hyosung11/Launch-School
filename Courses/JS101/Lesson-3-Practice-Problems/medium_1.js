Practice Problems: Medium 1 */

/* ========================================================

Question 1

Let's do some "ASCII Art": a stone-age form of nerd artwork from back in the days before computers had video screens.

For this practice problem, write a program that outputs The Flintstones Rock! 10 times, with each line indented 1 space to the right of the line above it. The output should start out like this:

The Flintstones Rock!
 The Flintstones Rock!
  The Flintstones Rock!
   ...
 */

// for (let padding = 1; padding <= 10; padding++) {
//   console.log(" ".repeat(padding) + "The Flintstones Rock!");
// }

/* ========================================================

Question 2

Starting with the string: */

// let munstersDescription = 'The Munsters are creepy and spooky.';

// Return a new string that swaps the case of all of the letters:

// `tHE mUNSTERS ARE CREEPY AND SPOOKY.`;

// munstersDescription.split("").map(function(char) {
//   if (char === char.toUpperCase()) {
//     return char.toLowerCase();
//   } else {
//     return char.toUpperCase();
//   }
// }).join("");

/* ========================================================

Question 3

Alan wrote the following function, which was intended to return all of the factors of number: */

// function factors(number) {
//   let divisor = number;
//   let factors = [];
//   do {
//     if (number % divisor === 0) {
//       factors.push(number / divisor);
//     }
//     divisor -= 1;
//   } while (divisor !== 0);
//   return factors;
// }

/* Alyssa noticed that this code would fail when the input is 0 or a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can he make this work without using a do/while loop? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop. */

// console.log(factors(45)); // [ 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45 ]
// console.log(factors(0)); FATAL ERROR: invalid array length Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
// console.log(factors(-1));

// Use a while condition for the loop
// function factors(number) {
//   let divisor = number;
//   let factors = [];

//   while (divisor > 0) {
//     if (number % divisor === 0) {
//       factors.push(number / divisor);
//     }
//     divisor -= 1;
//   }

//   return factors;
// }

// console.log(factors(0)); // []
// console.log(factors(-5)); // []
// console.log(factors(27)); // [1, 3, 9, 27]

// How does the result differ if you replace line 3 with `factors.push(divisor);?

// console.log(factors(27)); // => [ 27, 9, 3, 1 ]

// Bonus: What is the purpose of `number % divisor === 0` in that code?

// Bonus Answer:
// It determines whether the result of the division is an integer -- if the number has no remainder, the result is an integer, so the number divided by the divisor is a factor.

/* ========================================================

Question 4

Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. You can add and remove elements from a rolling buffer. However, once the buffer becomes full, any new elements will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

She wrote two implementations of the code for adding elements to the buffer. In presenting the code to her team leader, she said "Take your pick. Do you prefer push() or concat() for modifying the buffer?".

Is there a difference between these implementations, other than the method she used to add an element to the buffer? */

// using push()
// function addToRollingBuffer1(buffer, maxBufferSize, newElement) {
//   buffer.push(newElement);
//   if (buffer.length > maxBufferSize) {
//     buffer.shift();
//   }
//   return buffer;
// }

// // using concat()
// function addToRollingBuffer2(buffer, maxBufferSize, newElement) {
//   buffer = buffer.concat(newElement);
//   if (buffer.length > maxBufferSize) {
//     buffer.shift();
//   }
//   return buffer;
// }

/* Yes, there is a difference. While both methods have the same return value, the first implementation mutates the argument represented by `buffer`. That is, the caller will see that the array is different when the function returns. The `rollingBuffer2` implementation doesn't mutate the argument specified by the value of `buffer`. */

/* ========================================================

Question 5

What will the following two lines of code output? */

// console.log(0.3 + 0.6); // 0.8999999999999999
// console.log(0.3 + 0.6 === 0.9); // false

/* Solution 5

If you thought that the outputs would be `0.9` and `true`, respectively, you were wrong. JavaScript uses floating point numbers for all numeric operations. Most floating point representations used on computers lack a certain amount of precision, and that can yield unexpected results like these.

In this case, the output was: */

// 0.8999999999999999
// false

/* ========================================================

Question 6

What do you think the following code will output? */

// let nanArray = [NaN];

// console.log(nanArray[0] === NaN); // false

/* The output is `false`. `NaN` -- not a number -- is a special numeric value that indicates that an operation that was intended to return a number failed. JavaScript does not let you use `==` and `===` to determine whether a value is `NaN`. */

// Bonus:

// How can you reliably test if a value is NaN?

// Bonus Answer:

// To test whether the value is NaN, we use the `Number.isNaN()` method:

// console.log(Number.isNaN(nanArray[0])); // true

/* ========================================================

Question 7

What is the output of the following code? */

// let answer = 42;

// function messWithIt(someNumber) {
//   return (someNumber += 8);
// }

// let newAnswer = messWithIt(answer);

// console.log(answer - 8);

// Solution 7 => 34

/* ========================================================

Question 8

One day, Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer, and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data: */

let munsters = {
  Herman: { age: 32, gender: 'male' },
  Lily: { age: 30, gender: 'female' },
  Grandpa: { age: 402, gender: 'male' },
  Eddie: { age: 10, gender: 'male' },
  Marilyn: { age: 23, gender: 'female' },
};

function messWithDemographics(demoObject) {
  Object.values(demoObject).forEach((familyMember) => {
    familyMember['age'] += 42;
    familyMember['gender'] = 'other';
  });
}

// After writing this function, he typed the following code:

// console.log(messWithDemographics(munsters));
// console.log(munsters);
// {
//   Herman: { age: 74, gender: 'other' },
//   Lily: { age: 72, gender: 'other' },
//   Grandpa: { age: 444, gender: 'other' },
//   Eddie: { age: 52, gender: 'other' },
//   Marilyn: { age: 65, gender: 'other' }
// }

// Before Grandpa could stop him, Spot hit the Enter key with his tail. Did the family's data get ransacked? Why or why not?

/* Solution 8

Spot will find himself in the "dog house" for this one. The family's data is in shambles now.

Why? In JavaScript, objects are passed by reference. Thus, Spot's demoObject starts off pointing to the munsters object. His program could replace that with some other object, and the family's data would be safe. However, in this case, the program doesn't reassign demoObject; it just uses it, as-is. Thus, the object that gets changed by the function is the munsters object. */

/* ========================================================

Question 9

Function and method calls can take expressions as arguments. Suppose we define a function named rps as follows, which follows the classic rules of the rock-paper-scissors game, but with a slight twist: in the event of a tie, it just returns the choice made by both players. */

function rps(fist1, fist2) {
  if (fist1 === 'rock') {
    return fist2 === "paper" ? "paper" : "rock";
  } else if (fist1 === "paper") {
    return fist2 === "scissors" ? "scissors" : "paper";
  } else {
    return fist2 === "rock" ? "rock" : "scissors";
  }
}

// What does the following code output?

// console.log(rps(rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")), "rock"));// => "paper"

/* Solution 9

The outermost call determines the result of comparing `rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")) against `rock`.That means we must evaluate the two separate calls, `rps("rock", "paper") and rps("rock", "scissors"), and combine them by calling `rps` on their results. Those innermost expressions return `"paper"` and `"rock"`, respectively. Calling `rps` on those two values returns `"paper"`, which when evaluated against `"rock"`, returns `"paper"`.
*/

/* ========================================================

Question 10

Consider these two simple functions: */

function foo(param = "no") {
  return "yes";
}

function bar(param = "no") {
  return param === "no" ? "yes" : "no";
}

// What will the following invocation return?

console.log(bar(foo()));

// Solution 10

// => "no"

// This is because the value returned from the `foo` function will always be `"yes"`, and `"yes" === "no"` will be `false`.
