# Lesson 3: Practice Problems Notes

## Introduction

At this point, you should have a basic familiarity with JavaScript syntax and foundational programming constructs. However, that knowledge immediately starts to fade from memory the moment you step away from programming. As with mastering any skill, it takes hundreds of hours of practice for your fingers to gain muscle memory and for your knowledge to move to long term memory.

One challenge for beginning programmers is trying to find the right types of practice problems. Again, just like acquiring any skill, it's vital to practice basics in isolation first, without being confused by more advanced topics. You need to learn new topics, then practice them in isolation, then learn new topics, and repeat. After a certain amount of practice, you will be ready to learn in context with a project.

The purpose of this lesson is to help you practice topics in isolation without introducing you to advanced topics, or challenging you to think about the context within a larger project. Think of it as jump-roping, or doing push-ups for your programming mind. You may not understand the impact of each practice problem, but, over time, you'll see results and be able to perform better when you work on more complicated programs.

You have already encountered most of these concepts in previous lessons and assignments; in this lesson, we'll explore some of them in greater depth. Be prepared to *use the MDN documentation* to answer some questions.

Not all of the questions in this lesson are review for previously discussed topics. Several touch on areas that are new. If you come upon a question that asks about an unfamiliar concept, don't panic. Instead, try looking at the MDN documentation or try to reason out the answer on your own. In such cases, we usually go into more depth in the answer's discussion, but try to figure things out yourself before you peek at the answer.

Before you start, make sure to create a new directory for this lesson. Call it perhaps lesson_3, and do all your work in this lesson in that directory.

Your working directory should now look something like this:

```sh
work            <-- this is your course 1 git repo
|
+--lesson_2     <-- all lesson 2 code goes here
|
+--lesson_3     <-- all lesson 3 code goes here
```

We won't be running ESLint on the code in this lesson since the programs are small and contained. We want to focus on learning to problem solve and debugging.
