# Solving Coding Problems with [PEDAC](https://medium.com/launch-school/solving-coding-problems-with-pedac-29141331f93f)

1. Useful for beginners to employ a system of thinking.
2. Gateway concept for more formal algorithmic techniques to problem solving.

## What is PEDAC?

- PEDAC stands for "[Understand the] Problem, Examples / Test Cases, Data Structure, Algorithm, and Code. 
- PEDAC's objectives are to process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

#### PEDAC
| Objective | Step | Description|
| :--- | :---  | :-----      |
| Process the Problem | Understand the Problem | <ul><li>Identify expected input and output</li><li>Make the requirements explicit</li><li>Identify rules</li><li>Mental model of the problem (optional)</li></ul> |
| | Examples/Test Case | Validate understanding of the problem |
| | Data Structure | How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output. |
| | Algorithm | Steps for converting input to output |
| Code with Intent | Code | Implementation of Algorithm |
