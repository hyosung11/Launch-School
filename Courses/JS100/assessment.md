# Assessment

## The Assessment

Before you start the paid courses, please write an email to `hello@launchschool.com` and introduce yourself. Consider this email your first assessment at Launch School, so please make an effort to answer, in detail, each of the bullet points below. While there is no minimum word requirement, most people send in an email between 500-1000+ words. We spent a lot of time on the Prep courses; all we ask is that you spend some time telling us about yourself and your journey.

Please include the following in your email:

* Your name. => Introduction
  * My name is HyoSung Jonathon Bidol-Lee. I live in Ridgewood, NJ, USA, a suburb of New York City. I'm married and the father of two children.
* Your education and professional background, especially any prior programming experience. Please don't send a 1- or 2-sentence answer to this item. We will ask for more information if you do.
  * 
* Your goal after finishing Launch School.
* How you discovered Launch School.
* What is your impression of the Prep courses that you just completed? Which parts were easy for you? Which were difficult? What did you enjoy? What didn't you like?
* How long did it take you to complete the Prep courses end-to-end?
* Confirm that you read the Mastery Based Learning article or watched the video at the bottom of that page.
* Confirm that you read the book Mastery, by George Leonard.
* Confirm that you read through and studied all three books in the prep course (command line, git/Github, and Introduction to Programming).
* Confirm that you finished all of the JavaScript Basics exercises and that you're ready to start the JavaScript Track.
* Confirm that you understand that Launch School doesn't issue refunds and that you are ready to start the subscription/paid courses at Launch School.

Please use the same email address that you use to log in to Launch School. If you do use a different email address, let us know your Launch School login.

You will not be able to subscribe until we review your introduction email. Please give us at least 1 business day to reply. If you do not receive a reply within 3 business days, please send a follow up email. Please do not ask in the Chat Room or send follow up emails sooner than 3 business days. Thank you.

Thank you! We will be in touch! Please skip the rest of this assignment.
