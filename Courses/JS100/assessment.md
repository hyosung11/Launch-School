# Assessment

## The Assessment

Before you start the paid courses, please write an email to `hello@launchschool.com` and introduce yourself. Consider this email your first assessment at Launch School, so please make an effort to answer, in detail, each of the bullet points below. While there is no minimum word requirement, most people send in an email between 500-1000+ words. We spent a lot of time on the Prep courses; all we ask is that you spend some time telling us about yourself and your journey.

Please include the following in your email:

* Your name.

INTRODUCTION

  * ~~freeCodeCamp~~
  * ~~Udemy courses~~
  *~~ hacker dabbler obsessive master ~~

On May 21, 2021, I was involuntarily terminated from my position as Project Manager/Scrum Master at Catalogic Software. The company decided to sell its OEM database product to IBM. IBM had been leasing the product for many years prior to the sale. As the project manager on the product, my primary responsibility was to coordinate and communicate with project managers and offering management on the IBM side. Most of the engineering team from my company moved to IBM. IBM didn't hire me as my role was redundant once the product was sold. Since I lacked the technical skills and experience to continue to work at Catalogic, which would have made me indispensable, I was let go.

The termination has been a blessing in disguise. In the weeks since being laid off, I have returned to programming. My original journey into programming began as a child when I dabbled with the BASIC programming language while my mother studied computer science. I remember the fascination of writing code on a TRS-80 computer and watching the output on the monitor. I loved that feedback loop. That journey ended in childhood as I moved on to other subjects in my educational development. But I planted a seed.

The software engineering seed began to grow two years ago when I decided to make another career change. After college, I began my first career as a teacher and professor. This career spanned thirteen years and included working with students from kindergarten through college adults. Ready for a new challenge, I enrolled in law school. After law school, I worked as an attorney for ten years, primarily in civil litigation of employment matters.

In the spring of 2019, I read about Blockchain. It piqued my curiosity, especially the concept of smart contracts. In _Blockchain: The Next Everything_, Stephen Williams writes: "Blockchain is software. It's as simple as that." I wanted to learn more. So, I bought the book *Coding for Beginners* and started hacking away. I didn't finish the book. I decided to go online and started freeCodeCamp. I liked the format and once again the feedback loop, but I didn't understand what I was doing. Hooked by coding, I realized I wanted professional help and live human interaction.

Jumping all in, I considered my options to continue coding. I quickly dismissed the path through a traditional computer science degree as taking too long and being too expensive. Serendipitously, or so I thought at the time, I found out about coding bootcamps. I researched my options and chose the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Remote program. I learned a lot. I loved interacting with my cohort. I appreciated the support and feedback of the instructors. I built a couple of fullstack web apps. But the program moved too fast from fundamentals through fullstack web applications. I didn't have time to process what I was learning before we moved onto the next topic. I felt frustrated and lost at times as I worked through the course material and didn't understand the basics well enough to turn the bricks into a building. I was copying code without knowing what I was doing and why.

Coding bootcamp ended. I felt like an impostor. I applied to software engineer positions. Almost all of my applications were rejected. I got one phone interview. The company asked me to come for an onsite interview. I fumbled answers to easy computer science questions. I couldn't complete a simple whiteboard coding challenge. I didn't get the job.

I wanted to "be so good they can't ignore you." I watched the beginning of Harvard's CS50 course. I bought Udemy courses. I copied the code line by line of the Udemy courses. I added the projects to my github profile. I went back to freeCodeCamp and did more modules. I attempted coding challenges on different platforms. I obsessed over data structures and algorithms. I went an inch deep and a mile wide, far from mastery.

In the meantime, I kept applying to software engineer positions, and other technical roles in software companies. After applying for a QA engineer position at Catalogic Software, the COO checked out my LinkedIn profile. I messaged him. He asked to meet me. We met and talked. The COO said I might make a good solutions engineer. He arranged an onsite interview with his team. I submitted an online coding challenge. I did four interviews in one day for a solutions engineer position. I got the job. I had no knowledge of IT Infrastructure. I struggled daily to learn basic technical concepts of system administration, networking, and virtualization to implement them in my job. I lacked foundational knowledge. I didn't have a scaffold from which I could create my competence. Six months into the job, the COO asked me to become the project manager, and I switched roles.

In the weeks since my termination, I have had time to ruminate on what I want to do for work. I want to work as a software engineer. Through my self-reflection, I realize I need to master the fundamental of programming. I believe that materials beat methods. The Launch School curriculum and platform provides a great path to mastery.

~~love technology. Technology is the engine of human progress. I want ~~

~~After my termination, I spent the end of May and the beginning of June applying to project manager positions with mixed emotions. I felt like I get a job fast. csm certification. what do I really want to do. started coding again. talked to GA bootcamp friends. help. be so good they can't ignore you cal newport~~

LAUNCH SCHOOL QUESTIONS

* Your goal after finishing Launch School.

  * After finishing Launch School, my goal is to work as a professional software engineer. I want to work at a company developing a product that meshes with my values. In this role, I want to apply my specific knowledge with absolute accountability. By leveraging this at scale, I hope to help billions of people. If all goes well, I would like to achieve financial freedom for my family.

* How you discovered Launch School.

  * In an email message I received from "Learn to Code with Me" the author mentioned Launch School as an alternative to a coding bootcamp. I followed the link and down the rabbit hole.

* What is your impression of the Prep courses that you just completed? Which parts were easy for you? Which were difficult? What did you enjoy? What didn't you like?

I enjoyed working through the Prep courses. The courses provided a good review of the basics that I had learned prior in my coding bootcamp and online courses. I found the presentation and sequence of the material to be well-thought. Doing the Prep courses solidified previous knowledge and filled in gaps of knowledge.

The high level review of concepts seemed easy and enjoyable for me. I liked encountering things I previously knew and affirming that I understood the concepts. 

I still find implementing concepts into code with precision challenging. I like this challenge and welcome it on the road to mastery. I realize I need to slow down and break an exercise down step-by-step. I like PEDAC. It reminds me of IRAC from law school where we had to approach a case sequentially by examining the Issue, delineating the Rule, Applying the law, to ascertain the Conclusion.

In some sections I wanted more examples to illustrate the concept. This would be in addition to the exercises at the end of each chapter and the ones in JavaScript Basics.

  * thorough fun hard fundamental good review liked it well-thought out. clear what I have been looking for 
    * easy - review of concepts
    * difficult - slowing my mind down enough to really master the concepts and then actually code them out correctly
    * enjoy the learning process; the feedback loop still
    * didn't like 
    * more exercises in the lecture section as well
* 
* How long did it take you to complete the Prep courses end-to-end?

  * I started the Prep courses on July 2 and finished on July 12. I worked more than eight hours a day on the material. Most of the material was a review and a refresher of content I had already learned in my coding bootcamp and from self-learning through Udemy Courses, freeCodeCamp, and other sources.
