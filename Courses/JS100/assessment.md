## The Assessment

Before you start the paid courses, please write an email to `hello@launchschool.com` and introduce yourself. Consider this email your first assessment at Launch School, so please make an effort to answer, in detail, each of the bullet points below.

We spent a lot of time on the Prep courses; all we ask is that you spend some time telling us about yourself and your journey.
