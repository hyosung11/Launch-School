# Assessment

## The Assessment

Before you start the paid courses, please write an email to `hello@launchschool.com` and introduce yourself. Consider this email your first assessment at Launch School, so please make an effort to answer, in detail, each of the bullet points below. While there is no minimum word requirement, most people send in an email between 500-1000+ words. We spent a lot of time on the Prep courses; all we ask is that you spend some time telling us about yourself and your journey.

Please include the following in your email:

* Your name.

INTRODUCTION

  * My full name is HyoSung Jonathon Bidol-Lee. You can call me 'H'. I live in Ridgewood, NJ, USA, a suburb of New York City. I'm married and the father of two children.

EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
* Your education and professional background, especially any _prior programming experience_. Please don't send a 1- or 2-sentence answer to this item. We will ask for more information if you do.

  * ~~laid off from Catalogic~~
  * MA in Teaching
  * JD from NYLS
  * BA in History from UM
  * GA coding bootcamp
  * freeCodeCamp
  * Udemy courses

On May 21, 2021, I was involuntarily terminated from my position as Project Manager/Scrum Master at Catalogic Software. The company decided to sell its OEM database product to IBM. IBM had been leasing the product for many years prior to the sale. As the project manager on the product, my primary responsibility was to coordinate and communicate with project managers and offering management on the IBM side. Most of the engineering team from my company moved to IBM. IBM didn't hire me as my role was redundant once the product was sold. Since I lacked the technical skills and experience to work as a software engineer at Catalogic, which would have made me indispensable, I was let go.

The termination has been a blessing in disguise. In the weeks since being laid off, I have returned to programming. My original journey into programming began as a child when I dabbled with the BASIC programming language while my mother studied computer science. I remember the fascination of writing code on a TRS-80 computer and watching the output on the monitor. I loved that feedback loop. That journey ended in childhood as I moved on to other subjects in my educational development. But I planted a seed.

The software engineering seed began to grow two years ago when I decided to make another career change. After college, I began my first career as a teacher and professor. This career spanned thirteen years and included working with students from kindergarten through college adults. Ready for a new challenge, I enrolled in law school. After law school, I worked as an attorney for ten years.

In the spring of 2019, I first read about Blockchain. It piqued my curiosity, especially the concept of smart contracts.

in being a software engineer is the third iteration of my career. prior i was a teacher/professor and an attorney

* Your goal after finishing Launch School.

  * After finishing Launch School, I plan to apply for and earn a role as a professional software engineer at a small to mid-size company working on a product that meshes with my values to provide a service that helps people ...

* How you discovered Launch School.

  * In an email message I received from `<Learn to Code with Me>` the author mentioned Launch School as an alternative to a coding bootcamp. I followed the link and down the rabbit hole. 

* What is your impression of the Prep courses that you just completed? Which parts were easy for you? Which were difficult? What did you enjoy? What didn't you like?

  * thorough fun hard fundamental good review liked it well-thought out. clear what I have been looking for 
    * easy - review of concepts
    * difficult - slowing my mind down enough to really master the concepts and then actually code them out correctly
    * enjoy the learning process; the feedback loop still
    * didn't like 
* 
* How long did it take you to complete the Prep courses end-to-end?

  * I started the Prep course on July 2 and finished on July 11. I worked more than eight hours a day on the material. Most of the material was a review and refresher of content I had already learned in my coding bootcamp and from self-learning through Udemy Courses, freeCodeCamp, and other sources.

CONFIRMATIONS

* Confirm that you read the Mastery Based Learning article or watched the video at the bottom of that page.

  I read the Mastery Based Learning article and all the links from that article as well. 

* Confirm that you read the book Mastery, by George Leonard.
