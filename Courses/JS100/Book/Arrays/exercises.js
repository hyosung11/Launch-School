// Arrays Exercises

// 1. In the following code, what are the final `length` values for `array1`, `array2`, `array3`, `array4`, and `array5`?

// let array1 = [1, 2, undefined, 4];
// console.log(array1.length); // => 4

// // The length of array1 is 4. The length is the highest index position that has a value, plus 1. In this case, the highest index position that has a value is 3; add 1 to that, and we get the length value of 4.

// let array2 = [1];
// array2.length = 5;
// console.log(array2.length); // => 5

// // The length of array2 is 5. You can set the length of an array. Even if the highest index position that has a value assigned is 0, assigning a new length of 5 overrides that length. For now, you can think of the resulting array as having 5 elements of which the last 4 have a value of undefined. In actuality, the array still has only one element, but has 4 gaps at the end -- the gaps aren't real elements and take up very little memory.

// let array3 = [];
// array3[-1] = [1];
// console.log(array3.length); // => 0

// // The length of array3 is 0. Index positions must be non-negative integers starting from 0. Negative and non-integer indexes don't get taken into account when determining an array's length.

// let array4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// array4.length = 3;
// console.log(array4.length); // => 3

// // The length of array4 is 3. Contrast this with array2. When you set an array to a length that is shorter than its current length, the array gets truncated to the new length. In this example, JavaScript truncates the array by removing the last two elements, leaving a total of 3 elements.

// let array5 = [];
// array5[100] = 3;
// console.log(array5.length); // => 101

// // The length of array5 is 101. As already noted, the length is the highest index position that has a value, plus 1. In this case, the highest index position that has a value is 100, so the length is 101.

// 2. Log all of the even values from myArray to the console.

// let myArray = [1, 3, 6, 11, 4, 2, 4, 9, 17, 16, 0];


// for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) {
//   let value = myArray[i];
//   if (value % 2 === 0); {
//     console.log(value);
//   }
// }

// 6
// 4
// 2
// 4
// 16
// 0

// Our approach is straightforward: we iterate over all the elements in the array and check whether each element is even.

// Use `forEach` and let JS take care of the indexing:

// myArray.forEach(function(value) {
//   if (value % 2 === 0) {
//     console.log(value)
//   }
// });

// 3. Let's make the problem a little harder. In this problem, we're again interested in even numbers, but this time the numbers are in nested arrays in a single outer array.

let myArray = [
  [1, 3, 6, 11],
  [4, 2, 4],
  [9, 17, 16, 0],
];


// for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i += 1) {
//   for (let j = 0; j < myArray[i].length; j += 1) {
//     let value = myArray[i][j];
//     if (value % 2 === 0) {
//       console.log(value);
//     }
//   }
// }

// The approach is straightforward, but it's a bit verbose. However, the chained brackets in `myArray[i][j]` make it visually explicit that we're dealing with a two-dimensional nested array.

// As before, we can also use forEach to abstract away the messy details of indexes and stopping conditions:

myArray.forEach(function (nestedArray) {
  nestedArray.forEach(function(value) {
    if (value % 2 === 0) {{
      console.log(value);
    }}
  });
});
