Tuesday, March 1 @ 3pm Central / 4pm Eastern / 5pm AST
What time is that in your time zone?
Here’s our current meetup format:
Brief intros + tell us what you’re working on today (10 mins)
Silent writing - muted, cameras on or off - (40 mins)
Check in - how did it go? (10 mins)
Come work on whatever you want with us! Whether you’ve written nothing or you’ve got a draft started that needs editing, or you’re working on a video - anything you want to get done is OK.
See you then!

What about a code reading club? Not sure. Ah. Just take a few minutes to just talk and think. I did fancy myself to be a writer at one point. I did write two articles as part of the General Assembly coding bootcamp. I'm a little tired right now.
