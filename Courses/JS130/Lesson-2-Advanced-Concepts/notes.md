# Lesson 2 > Advanced Concepts

## 1. Introduction

With that bit of practice under your belt, it's time to move on and start learning some new concepts and techniques. We'll explore a bunch of new ideas, including hoisting, strict mode, closures, IIFEs, modules, exceptions, and garbage collection. It's a bit of a hodge-podge -- most of the assignments are standalone in that the later assignments don't lean heavily on the earlier ones. Nevertheless, the information presented is important.

At the end of this lesson, you'll have an excellent working knowledge of JavaScript, and will be ready to start using it in more advanced applications. Let's go!

## 2. The `var` Statement



### 2.1 What to Focus On

### 2.2 The `var` Statement

### 2.3 How do `var` and `let` Differ?

### 2.4 Scope and `var`

### 2.5 Summary

In this assignment, we introduced the `var` statement. Though the `var` statement is mostly "on the way out," it hasn't been deprecated as of 2019. In fact, it will probably still be around for a very long time to come.

Coming up next, we'll look more deeply at the concept of scope and how it applies to declarations in JavaScript.
