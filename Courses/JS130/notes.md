# JS130 More JavaScript Foundations Notes

## Summary

This course will cover some language specific aspects of the JavaScript programming language. We'll start with some additional programming practice, with a focus on emulating JavaScript's built-in iteration methods. We'll also create a small pair of classes that implement a todo list, after which we'll move on to a variety of topics that explore the nooks and crannies of JavaScript. In particular, we'll look at the var statement, hoisting, strict mode, closures, private data, immediately invoked functions, new ES6 shorthand syntax, modules, exceptions, and garbage collection. Then we'll take a brief dive into the world of testing with Jest, and follow that up with a brief lesson on how to package code for distribution. You'll be ready to move on to more advanced topics and projects after completing this course. You will also be able to work on a solve some programming challenges, both here, as well as at other coding practice sites like Codewars and Exercism.
