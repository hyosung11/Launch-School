# Launch School Mastery Based Learning Journey Journal

Started the Prep courses and finished on Sunday, 20210711.
Wrote and sent Assessment email on 20210711
Accepted and enrolled on Monday, 20210712

## 20210712 월요일

Still trying to figure out how best to use Anki cards.
What about agile/scrum development processes to go through the core curriculum?
accountability
daily standup meeting?
work in sprints?
user stories
study group?
LS Slack channel and community
cleaned up the office a little bit
a little tired and scattered at the moment. i had trouble sleeping last night as my mind felt excited to get to work. that's a good sign. this does feel like play to me. i'm having fun and enjoying myself

what type of role and in what kind of company do I want to work?
look at LS95 again

tired today. skipped the first quiz. I want to make my anki cards for the Prep courses and do at least one small problems set

[Six Rules for Good Git Hygiene](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2)

Always `pull` before a `push`.
`pull` frequently.
`push` frequently.
Commit frequently.

* Commit small, single changes with carefully crafted commit messages that tell what the small, discrete change is.
* If you need to use the word 'and', you are not committing enough.

Merge `forward` frequently.
Create `pull requests` infrequently.

Anki cards
Daily Scrum
study buddy
spent a lot of time reviewing the anki cards I made yesterday. I want to make more cards today before I do problems and take the quiz

14:28 still reviewing the Introduction to Programming book and making Anki cards. This is beneficial.

16:12 More review. God, I need to work on the problems instead of just looking at the answer.

17:55 I think reviewing the fundamentals will pay off later.

20:33 Finished Anki cards on arrays.

## 20210714 - 수요일 0:20

done for the day
got through all the Intro to Programming book with Anki cards

   1. I'm good right now

09:36 - pretty much finished Anki card review. I think 100 cards is too much for one review.\
09:50 - doing more cards, but am going to take a break for ten minutes and start working on exercises.\
10:10 - added speed focus mode to anki cards and finished 100 cards.

Use a`\` to create a line break.

[Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/markdown-basics?id=line-numbers)

line-numbers
You can enable line number for a code block by adding line-numbers class.

```javascript {.line-numbers} {highlight=2}
aa
bb
cc
```

* this doesn't show up in GitHub

13:36 - reviewing my notes and code from the Intro to PEDAC study session. Time to take a break and go outside.

15:28 I looked at the PEDAC problem again. I need to train in coding cleanly over and over again.

17:22 worked through some JavaScript Basics exercises. Time to make dinner. I wonder if I should disable some of these extensions?

19:52 made dinner, went for bike ride with SungOh and did Easy 1 > Isn't it Odd? exercise. It was fun to figure out by researching the `Math.abs()` function

21:52 submitted odd_numbers.js solution and looked at the other solutions.

22:10 submitted even_numbers.js solution which was super similar to odd_numbers.js

22:31 started How Big is the room with setup of readline-sync, but going to sleep now.

23:08 Jordan Whistler demonstrated Live Share for VS Code with me.

## 20210715 목요일

09:00 I asked Byron to do a daily scrum/standup at 11:00. We'll see if he responds. I also asked Alex to do a study session tomorrow morning.

09:05 Study Tips from Mandy Cheang (TA)  09:00 => check `mandy_cheang_study_tips.md`

## Mandy Cheang Study Tips from Slack Message

Good morning!
My best tips would probably be:

* mindset, have a growth mindset
* be kind and patient to yourself, take breaks and rest when you need. Your brain also is working in the backend when you're resting. (diffuse mode)
* be self aware, iterate through your process of learning, get feedback, and ask structure questions when you don't understand. So "I tried this and that, my mental model is currently is this. But I don't know what is happening when the output is X, when I expect it to be Y."
* active recall, flash cards, teaching, but have some way to evaluate yourself or something else to evaluate you
* mistakes are opportunities
* try to make as MANY mistakes as you can and figure out the gaps in your knowledge before the assessment / interview
* I use to "highlight and re-read" all the time, it's not effective.
* I do take notes but I take notes in question form and convert them to anki flash cards
* If you are struggling, don't try to tackle everything at once, break it down to the pieces and tackle each piece incrementally. Then everything will come together as a whole. Ex. You can't solve a coding problem within 20 minutes. It's not very effective if you keep coding with other students without working on yourself and the individual pieces your struggling with. In order to get faster, practice being familiar at the methods you can use, be rock solid on loops and iterations, then practice breaking down the problem, practice the algorithm. These are all pieces you can practice individually and be aware which pieces your struggling with and try to tackle that. It's like weight-lifting or playing a sport. If you want to have a strong full body or your training for a sport, you work on biceps for a while, then you work on legs, then everything comes together as a whole.
* Don't worry about learning how to study, it's not a detriment of actually studying. I spent months iterating and learning more on how to learn. It pays dividends and your efforts will compound overtime. Learning how to learn effectively has been the best investment in my life.
* Ok that was a lot. I have more resources for you if you're interested in taking a look. These things have helped me:
* One last great tip is, study with others. If you haven't already, check out the #the-spot you can find a lot of other students on the same course, same path.

[How to Create and Practice Flashcards Like a Boss](https://medium.com/@iDoRecall/https-medium-com-idorecall-how-to-create-and-practice-flashcards-like-a-boss-b7efb5a53293)

* flashcards are utilized for building easy recall of the things that you’ve already learned.
* Create your flashcards while consuming your learning content. (When I use the word content, I’m referring to the academic materials that you can read, watch or listen to.)
* read things only once.
* The only active approach is to _practice retrieving what you learn from memory_.
* Read once and create flashcards as you work your way through the material:
  * capture all the concepts and facts you want to remember
  * Once you have processed that piece of learning content, meaning once you have read it in its entirety and created the necessary flashcards, mark it as completed.
  * Then use the flashcards and retrieval practice as your primary tools for remembering the key concepts and facts forever.
* When you create a flashcard, draft the question and answer from memory.
* On every flashcard, ask only one question and whenever possible, only one answer.
* the most challenging flashcards are the ones where you have to retrieve a large collection of items from memory.
* keep the question concise but make it just long enough to be explicit and clear
* carefully craft your question to elicit the best and most complete answer
  * think like a trial attorney who is examining a witness
* it's better for a question to be longer than the answer
* keep answers short, simple and specific to stimulate synaptic strengthening.
* use a combination of words and images -- dual coding -- to encode the question because it's easier to retrieve from memory
* You can use an image as the question
* Use colors and rich text formatting to make the text more memorable
* use humor, narrative and personal examples to make flashcards more interesting
* create flashcards for the most important facts that represent the core material you'll be expected to know (don't make cards for unimportant things)
* create flashcards for both directions
* use screengrabs (screenshots) liberally
* break it down into its component parts and test your comprehension
* use tags to organize your recalls (sessions) and library items
* append a metacognitive question to the end of the answer
* use cloze deletion questions
* Open-ended questions are more challenging than cloze deletion type or multiple-choice questions.
* use flashcards answers as an opportunity to build associations with other parts of your knowledge base
* craft why questions - deeper level of knowledge of understanding
  * what is cancer (shallow) vs why does cancer exist in nature (deeper)
* create multiple flashcards for the same concept that examine it from different viewpoints
* use mnemonic devices
  * acronyms
  * rhymes too
  * memory palace, especially for enumerations

Practice Process

* make a solid effort to retrieve the answer from memory first (retrieval practice, duh)
  * if unsuccessful, admit that you don't recall the answer
* tag each course and use additional tags for different topics within a subject
  * use interleaving to enhance the power of practice
* use spaced-repetition and manual study
* respond out loud - talk to yourself to promote metacognition
* edit cards during practice to fix errors, add new learning and highlight areas of struggle
* go back to source content to refresh your memory if you struggle with an answer
* study in new contexts - time and location
* practice before you sleep to take advantage of sleep's memory consolidation powers
* break up practice sessions into several pieces to make them less tedious

10:45 time for a break and to see if Byron and I connect today.

11:09 nothing from Byron. I want to find a study partner and/or group.

11:54 solved the `how_big_is_the_room.js` exercise without glancing at the solution. Woot Woot. Used PEDAC. This is fun.

12:00 lunch break then look at the LS solution and other solutions.

12:46 back after lunch.looking at my trello board at the moment.

14:40 making slow progress and sharpening my use of PEDAC.

16:09 finished `tip_calculator.js` and see different ways to write the solution. much to learn young padawan. much to learn.

16:42 I took a break and did some Anki cards. I also got a snack. I'm a little tired.

19:08 started `sum_or_product.js`

08:02 time for family breakfast

09:00 Planning and scheduling this morning. Next study Anki cards for an hour and then take JS101 Lesson 1 Quiz 1.

10:01 Studied 22 Anki cards in 4.56 minutes today (12.43s/card). This doesn't account for the many other minutes editing cards as I studied.

10:49 Took a break and did Nerf Wars with SungOh and drawing with Omi. I enjoyed playing with my kids. Ready to start Quiz 1.

12:20 Okay, take a deep breath. I got 6/9 on the first quiz. Made some careless mistakes thinking I was sure of the answer. Understand the questions!

13:38 After making fried rice with Omi and eating it together. I still need to sit sometimes.

14:48 Finished Sprint 1 Review. Working on Sprint 1 Retrospective.

15:27 Finished Sprint 2 Planning session. Now I need to make cards in Trello for Sprint 2. I enjoy this.

15:58 Watching Mandy Cheang's video

[Use what you know: A journey into metacognition ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bWY8zSMFOo)

Summary

* Metacognition can deepen learning
* Understand what you need from your study tools
* Typora is a markdown editor
* Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program
* Retrieval practice helps with retaining information
* It's OK to not know what you need at first
* Learning how to learn is a process

18:15 Finished Lesson 2 Assignments 1-4. Going to eat dinner. Quiche that Sohee made. Yum.

18:57 Back at my office work station, but my legs feel tired.I think this retina display monitor is better though.

19:46 Finished `calculator.js` following the video. Up for children's bedtime now.

### VS Code Git Status Colors

* Change a line and it goes blue.
* Add a new line and it goes green.
* Do either of these and your file turns yellow in the Explorer.
* Commit and all the colours disappear again.

21:00 Finished coding the `calculator.js` app again using the text instead of the video this time. Getting off now to watch TV with Sohee. Good night for now. I enjoyed today.

09:08 Studied 8 cards, but edited each one. Back from breakfast and ready to get to the next assignment.

09:38 write out the code blocks myself instead of just copying them!

10:04 Trying to disable extensions that code complete or suggest, but can't figure it out.

10:22 I think I found and disabled the extensions that I want to disable, but I will restart now.

12:37 Back from anniversary brunch and dunkin' donuts. ready to program more.

13:24 Finished Flowchart Assignment.

13:47 submitted `multiply.js` solution.

14:00 study session with Laurent

15:14 Did two exercises with Laurent. I have things to learn.

17:35 I went down a wormhole because I can't get ESLint to work in Node. I'm going to let it go and make dinner. I have a linter for VS Code.

18:35 Back after preparing and making dinner. Dictation works in VS Code or VSC.

18:52 Giving up on getting ESLint to work in Node. I keep getting the error

```js

19:31 Worked through the `exclusive_or.js` exercise again by sketching in pencil the values as they get evaluated and change. It helped me to understand what is happening better.

20:18 I still can't get ESLint to work on either machine. Ugh.

21:16 Done for tonight with `calculator.js` version 2 via video walkthrough.

## 20210720 Tuesday

08:39 Getting started after soccer and family breakfast. Got the ESLint issue on my mind. I want to get it working. But I need to time-box it to 30 minutes.

   * I can't get ESLint to work in my environment because of `Error: Failed to load parser 'babel-eslint' declared in '../../../.eslintrc.yml': Cannot find module 'babel-eslint'`

09:17 Figured it out by reading the documentation. I needed to use an earlier version of ESLint and babel-eslint.

### Install `babel-eslint`

Ensure that you have substituted the correct version lock for `eslint` and `babel-eslint` into this command:

```sh
npm install eslint eslint-cli babel-eslint --save-dev
```

Use these version in my environment. Do I also need to install eslint-cli? What about using it as a VSC extension?

```sh
$ npm install eslint@4.x babel-eslint@8 --save-dev
# or
$ yarn add eslint@4.x babel-eslint@8 -D
```

09:49 Took a poop break. I'm going to read a little from *Mastery* before I do a few Anki cards. I also finished listening to LS Podcast S2E2

10:33 Studied 8 Anki cards.

12:07 Finished `calculator.js` second time via the book.

12:28 Back after lunch and ordering Misfits Market box. They're website has good UX and UI.

12:56 ESLint Assignment was short and completed.

13:31 Working on Debugging Assignment and going to move to office workstation.

14:19 Finished the Debugging Assignment. It's cool. So many tools and features to programming. I love it.

15:03 Finished Errors Assignment.

16:00 Finished Preventing Errors Assignment.

17:59 Finished 13. Preventing Errors, 14. Catching Errors, 15. Precedence, and 16. Assignment: Calculator Bonus Features part 1.

19:42 Added configuration file to `calculator.js` at `calculator_messages.json`. This is fun and cool.

20:59 16. Assignment: Calculator Bonus Features 2/3 completed. Still working on Internationalization.

21:59 Final commit for tonight. Watching NBA finals game 6 and going to bed to sleep before early study session with Alex tomorrow morning.

08:06 breakfast delayed to 8:30. Start Anki cards now.

08:36 Studied 11 cards in 1.88 minutes today (10.24s/card) with 30 minutes total of editing them.

09:18 Read Eamon O'Callaghan [JS109]'s article.

09:33 Back at the standing desk work station.

10:00 Working on Explicit Type Coercion assignment.

10:34 Emailed resume draft to Christine at NJDOL for our meeting tomorrow.

11:33 Got an interview with Encora for a TPM position. I have to research it.

12:21 Scheduled interview with Encora. I need to research the company.

12:33 Finished Explicit Type Coercion.

13:02 Working on Implicit Type Coercion. Really enjoying this.

13:17 taking a break to play ping pong

13:33 Not playing ping pong because Louis has his sister over at his house.

13:34 [35+ Mac Text-Editing Keyboard Shortcuts to Speed Up Typing](https://www.howtogeek.com/681662/35-mac-text-editing-keyboard-shortcuts-to-speed-up-typing/)

Moving the Cursor

You can use the arrow keys to move the cursor around and press Enter to start a new paragraph. Using the Option and Command keys as modifiers, you can move the cursor in the following ways:

* Option+Left Arrow: To the beginning of the previous word.
* Option+Right Arrow: To the beginning of the next word.
* Command+Left Arrow: To the beginning of the current line.
* Command+Right Arrow: To the end of the current line.
* Option+Up Arrow: To the beginning of the current paragraph.
* Option+Down Arrow: To the end of current paragraph.
* Shift+Enter: Starts a new line in apps like Messages, Slack, or WYSIWYG editors.

13:59 Back to work.

14:30 took a short nap.

14:39 Implicit Type Coercion assignment complete.

16:25 Did Odd Lists exercise with Laurent after he looked at my code for `calculator.js`.

16:36 I'm shutting down my office work station after making all my commits. Going to check email and messages and then review the Small Problems I did today with Alex and Laurent. I'm not sure about playing soccer tomorrow morning as my hamstring still feels tight.

19:27 I can't get ESLint to work properly in VSC. Not sure what's going on. It's a project unto itself as is Git.

19:51 Time to put the kids to bed and return to this later.

21:18 playing around with ESLint and I think I fixed it. I commented out the #parser and ignoreComments: true

```yml
3 #parser: babel/eslint-parser

61      ignoreComments: true
```

I think this means I can use the latest ESLint version.

21:52 I tried to uninstall ESLint globally, but I still have two versions and I can't seem to figure out how to get rid of them.

   * Remember [On Pace and Productivity](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2021/07/21/on-pace-and-productivity/)

09:22 Trying to settle down. I will read *Mastery* a bit after I poo and before I do some Anki cards.

09:38 Read a section of *Mastery* in the practice chapter. Ready to do some Anki cards.

10:01 Studied 8 cards in 1.46 minutes today (10.92s/card). I edited all 8 cards.

10:27 Chatting with Saro about Dr. Riotto. Going to push a commit here and then go to the office workstation. I will do the Walk-through: Calculator assignment again to practice before starting the Mortgage Calculator. This is still fun and interesting and challenging and what I want to be doing.

11:45 Did resume review with Christine Denning and scheduled an interview prep for Monday. Listening to music is great. I cleaned up the office and it feels good to be in here.

11:50 Ready to practice the Assignment: Calculator.

13:14 So much to learn about Node, NPM, ESLint, config files. ESLint is not reading my `.eslintrc.yml` file. Eyes are strained and my legs are tired. I am going to the dining room table now.

13:56 I notice that my mind is much sharper since I have been programming every day. I really want everything in my life to be organized well and so I am running algorithms on everything from the way that my wallet is organized to my external environment. This is so much fun to do all of this.

14:14 I finished Walk-through: Refactoring Calculator assignment with `calculator_practice.js`.

14:26 The Launch School curriculum is definitely the slow path to proficiency. I have spent the day going back through the Calculator assignment to do it again.

14:41 Good tips from Jordan Whistler

* `npm list`
* `npm ls -g` to see if it's installed globally
* `npm uninstall eslint -g`
* put the `yaml` file in the root folder there.

14:54 Now I have a different problem in that it seems I don't have NPM installed and working. Ugh.

16:12 After study session with Laurent. He figured it out completely differently than the LS solution. Bravo.

20:18 My last note was over four hours ago? I'm slipping. I had went for a short bike ride with SungOh, had dinner, did some more coding, picked up Omi and Claudia from MacKenzie Redmond's birthday party at Graydon, put the kids to bed and am back.

20:35 Coding Tips assignment completed.

20:42 Slow and steady today. I understand the calculator assignment much better now. I like learning new material. I need to enjoy the small problems exercises too. Taking a break to watch 'Never Have I Ever' with Sohee.

22:26 Watched two episodes of Never Have I Ever. Installed Firefox Developer Edition on both machines and my phone. It's faster than Safari and Chrome.

23:07 I have to go to sleep. I have a study session with Alex tomorrow at 6:00.

## 20210723 Friday

07:09 Did study session with Alex, but ended abruptly when SungOh woke up. We'll meet again on Sunday.

INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING: The Basics: Exercise

Use the arithmetic operators to determine the individual digits of a 4-digit number like 4936:

1. thousands place is 4
2. hundreds place is 9
3. tens place is 3
4. ones place is 6

```js
let number = 4936;

let ones = number % 10;
console.log(ones); // => 6

number = (number - ones) / 10;
console.log(number); // => 493

let tens = number % 10;
console.log(tens) // => 3

number = (number - tens) / 10;
console.log(number); // => 49

let hundreds = number % 10;
console.log(hundreds); // => 9

let thousands = (number - hundreds) / 10;
console.log(thousands); // => 4 */
```

10:32 Back from Dr. Riotto's with a healing hamstring. Working on Lesson 2 Assignment 21 on Variable Scope in the backyard. The cicadas are loud.

12:13 After study session with Mandy.

15:22 Tired. Took a short nap. Played ping pong with Louis. We were tied at 4-4 and then he won four straight. Ugh.

17:13 Finished Variable Scope Assignment.

17:15 Take some time to read Pro Git.

17:37 Markdown coloring looks wrong and I can't use font features.

18:22 Markdown was using babel-eslint. I couldn't figure out how to turn it off, so I just copied the `journal.md` file to `journal_20210723.md` file.

21:19 Done for now at the end of "Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value" assignment. I need to re-read "Variables as Pointers" tomorrow.

09:11 Tired after soccer. My hamstring is still not near 100%. Maybe I should see Dr. Riotto multiple times next week.

10:23 My Anki cards need improvement. I'm tired right now. I think I'm going to read the Coding Tips 2 assignment and then take a nap. We'll see. Also I want to read another chapter of *Mastery*.

10:32 So many great articles about using tools to program.

[How Markdown Helps Me Take Better, Faster Notes](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2018/01/13/markdown-note-taking/)

* VS Code features available through the Command-Palette (`cmd` + `shift` + `P`).

[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

    * ![emoji-rendered](emoji-rendered.png)
* [Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)

11:24 Just took a dump. I'm tired and my body feels sore. I want to take a nap. Okay, read *Mastery* chapter now.

11:47. I was writing in the wrong file. I hope this works. I am now writing in the right file.

11:51 Good job H. I got rid of the older `journal_20210723.md file`

11:52 I read the next chapter in *Mastery*. I like using Markdown in VS Code.

12:39 Fixed the `undefined` errors in my calculator assignment to add the config file. This is fun!

13:41 Back after prepping lunch and eating family lunch. I'm working on the internationalization of the calculator assignment. It's fun. I made a Korean, ko version.

14:35 I need to create some conditional logic to change the output to Korean, but I'm not sure how to do it as I get a TypeError:

```sh
/Users/hyosung11/Launch-School/Courses/JS101/Lesson-2-Small-Programs/calculator_practice.js:153
  if (LANGUAGE = 'ko') {
               ^

TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

I need to create a function that sets the language for the entire program. Not hard code it like I am doing now.

15:40 Took a short nap. I'm still tired. My eyes feel strained. Eye divergence exercises needed.

17:36 needed a nap and a break. ready to make dinner. i'll be back after dinner.

18:52 back after dinner. I ate too much and am 90% full instead of stopping at 80% full.

21:12 Working through Coding Tips 2. Taking a break to watch Ted Lasso with Sohee.

### [Vim Basics in 8 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggSyF1SVFr4)

Vim dumps you into command mode to start

* `:q` to quit Vim
* `w` writes to the file
* `:wq` to write and quit
* `q!` quit without saving changes
* `I` - `INSERT` mode
* `esc` switches back to command mode
* `set number` turns on line numbering
* `dd` deletes a line

08:23 Added Vim basic commands notes. Next time I have a Git problem, handle it better.

08:43 Feeling resistance to doing the Anki cards. Why? Do them while note taking? That doesn't make sense. I think it's read and take notes and then make cards, but that's not what the doctor recommends.

10:02 Worked on Anki cards. Slow and steady progress.

10:34 Took a break to play Nerf adventure with SungOh. It was fun. Now back to Lesson 2 > 25. Coding Tips 2

11:38 I'm tired again and my eyes feel strained as well as my right forearm. I switched my track pad to the left. Use dictation more? Am I just fueled by caffeine and I don't have any today so I don't feel as peppy? That's not true I actually did have one cup of coffee this morning.

11:49 I finished the "Gain experience through struggling" section of Coding Tips 2.

13:42 I'm tired but more energized after lunch. I'm ready to do Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Planning. I still haven't gone back to the Assignment: Mortgage / Car Loan Calculator. I did start listening to *A Mind for Numbers* by Barbara Oakley as an audiobook.

15:50 Finished Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, and Sprint Planning. The Sprint Planning went faster than last week. Time for a break.

16:35 Taking a break after starting the Walk-through Rock, Paper, Scissors assignment.

16:55 Finished Walk-through Rock Paper Scissors video version.

## 20210726 Monday

   * I feel really tired this morning.

07:54 My right hamstring still feels strained. I'm tired. My eyes are tired. Maybe I need to walk to the cemetary for memento mori? Or some ping pong?
08:52 After breakfast with the kids and telling a story using Nerf Guns as characters to engage SungOh. That was fun.

09:20 Checked email efficiently and took some notes on the right kind of coffee to drink as suggested by T-Nation. I miss training heavy at the gym. Going to start Anki cards now. I don't want a job right now as I want to devote my time and energy to studying the Launch School core curriculum. This reminds me that I want to check when certification for UI benefits is scheduled for me this week.

09:27 I still need to figure out how to make keyboard shortcuts in VS Code.

09:59 I studied 7 cards today. Edited each one as I went.

12:31 Finished helpful Interview Prep session with Christine Denning. I still don't want the job or any job right now. I'll work on the 'Walk-through: Rock Paper Scissors' text version after ping pong with Louis. I might do some more Anki cards right now.

14:25 Finally got 'Stringy Strings' solution to work. Little things that I need to pay attention to better.

14:35 Reviewed the LS solution to 'Stringy Strings'. I'm hungry now. Time to grab a snack.

14:56 Before study session with Laurent.

15:32 Going through Mochi cards that Laurent made. The six falsy values are 0FUNN'' - 0, false,undefined, NaN, Null and empty string. The red highlighting stopped.

16:19 Back from break pulling weeds in the backyard and got bit multiple times by mosquitoes. Ugh.

17:02 Good to take the breaks today. I opened up the Productivity Planner and think I will use it going forward despite doing the Daily Scrum Questions. Taking a break to make dinner now. I'll return to the rest of the Rock Paper Scissors assignment after dinner.

19:27 Back at my office workstation after dinner and cleanup. SungOh was sick and threw up but he feels better now. I completed the Concussion in Sports and emailed my completion certificate to Keith at BCSOA. Now trying to integrate the Productivity Planner into my work.

19:38 Wrote work items for tomorrow in the Productivity Planner. Going up to get ready for bed with the kids. Making a journal commit now. I might work more on Rock Paper Scissors after putting the kids to bed and before watching TV with Sohee.

20:46 Added features to Rock Paper Scissors through the video version. I'll do the text version later. Time to watch some TV with Sohee.

## 20210727 화요일

06:37 Awake and reading. I didn't play soccer this morning because I want to heal my hamstring. Alex declined to meet, so I have some free time this morning to read and write and do some work before my interview at 10:30. All is well.

06:59 *Mastery*: liberation comes through the acceptance of limits (129).

07:11 Need to do physical training everyday. My hamstring still feels strained. Dr. Riotto tomorrow?

07:44 I'm still reading *Learn Like a Pro* first chapter. Have a *ready-to-resume* plan before engaging a distraction.

07:57 Study between 6 ~ 8 hours per day in addition to classes. More than 8 hours per day doesn't improve grades. *Learn Like a Pro*, 9. What's the proper citation method? Don't listen to music, including binaural beats. It slows down learning.

09:11 After family breakfast and playing outside with SungOh.

   2. Remember to take breaks and practice the fundamental human movements!

11:18 Back to Launch School after the screening interview with Elias at Encora. I think it went well. I have made it to the next round. I need to research Agile/Scrum before the next interview. What is this resistance to doing the Mortgage Calculator assignment?

11:47 Okay, I started the Mortgage Calculator assignment. Now getting ready for the Algorithm Writing Clinic.

13:03 That was informative and showed my path to proficiency.

15:02 Back from ping pong and picking up Omi from Graydon.

17:40 After study session with Laurent. I need to spend some solo time working on exercises to train my problem-solving skills. Omi's warm but okay.

19:16 After delicious dinner that Sohee made of chicken fajitas. My eyes are tired. I will do some Anki cards now.

19:46 Did 5 Anki cards. Slow and steady.

20:21 Working on the text version of RPS assignment.

21:01 Finished refactoring the Rock Paper Scissors assignment.

21:23 Cleaned up spelling mistakes and unknown words.

## 20210728 수요일

07:20 After study session with Alex. I need to rep each problem multiple times. Even if I know the algorithm, I don't know the method or methods to use in JavaScript syntax. So much more to learn.

09:32 [Super Memory](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)

11:05 Got my mortgage calculator working with almost 100% copying of the LS solution. Baby steps. Step by step. Progress not perfection. Ready for a longer break.

11:49 Made Anki cards from the questions at the end of the Mortgage Calculator assignment.

13:59 Was AFK for ping pong where I got slaughtered today by Louis and then ate lunch and took a cold shower. My right elbow feels irritated even though I changed my trackpad to the left side. I feel tired and am going to take a nap.

14:38 Took a short nap and read *Kettlebell Simple & Sinister*.

14:55 I read through the RPS Bonus Features and watched the Big Bang Theory clip. I have to pee and take a five minute power break.

16:45 Made Anki cards from JS101 > JavaScript Basics > Reading Documentation 1. Good good good. I have to pee and then go outside for a few minutes before making dinner.

21:18 Made Anki cards from JS100 - JavaScript Basics > Reading Documentation 2

21:20 Start with JS100 - JavaScript Basics > Loops > Loop and Log tomorrow.

## 20210729 목요일

06:17 I bought and am reading Kettlebell Simple & Sinister Revised and Updated. Birds chirping loudly.

06:20 Something unpleasant is going on with my skin. It's bumpy and oozing and then crusting. Is it a mild case of shingles? I'm just guessing. Oh, I had another screening interview yesterday and will have a second interview with them next week. The company is called Triveni, I think.

08:21 Did the full KSS and feel great afterwards. I even did the stretches and the hanging from a pullup bar. Now time to enjoy some Omar hazelnut coffee and read before family breakfast.

08:33 read *Mastery* chapter. Now family breakfast.

09:21 Getting to Daily Scrum questions a little later today.

11:28 Finished *Mastery*. I skimmed the part about breathing and energy and ki. No ping pong with Louis. I want to practice soccer drills in my cleats and maybe even outside later during my siesta. I have a partial mind to move to my laptop now. Not sure that I will.

11:06 At the dining room table doing correspondence right now.

11:32 Tired today at the moment. I took a break for correspondence. Now listening to Pure Focus on Apple Music, but it has lyrics which is not good for studying.

08:17 At the dining room table cleaning up my git commits from my two different machines. Read a little before breakfast and then do my daily scrum. Okay.

08:51 After family breakfast. Drinking coffee and reading *Learn Like a Pro* chapter on "How to gain intuition and think fast".

11:31 Working with my Anki cards. Now time for a break to train.

3. Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?
   * My morning plan is to prep for my interview and have an interview prep meeting with my career coach. So I won't have as much time to study Launch School.

09:20 Kids are still here. I can't seem to focus right now. I planned to do KSS, but I feel delayed at the moment.

09:36 Vacillating at the moment. Not sure whether to continue studying or do KSS now. I postponed KSS until siesta time, so I can do more Launch School now. Go!

10:06 Reviewed a bunch of Anki cards and deleted most of the cards I made before because they aren't in the form of a question. Now shifting gears to prep for interview prep.

12:13 Finished prep for interview prep and interview prep with Christine. Ready to KSS!

13:04 Finished KSS in 46:00 including stretching. Ready for my siesta including some food after a quick cold shower.

14:06 Back to studying Strings.

14:57 Time for a break. Getting better and better, little by little.

17:18 Unproductive in the afternoon. I got coffee, gas for the car, and worked on my referee schedule for the fall.

20:19 Tired. Eyes tired. I started watching Beginner Git Tips. Going to couch and MBP now.

20:39 Working on Strings. It's fun. I can do this.

21:35 Finished Strings while watching the Olympics. Not great. Lack focus. Need to work on Capitalized Words tomorrow.

## 20210803 화요일

06:48 I can't decide what I want to do first this morning after meditation and a morning page in my journal.

07:10 Worked on capitalize words and making mistakes that I learn from, like forgetting to call the method `.toUpperCase` by forgetting the parentheses.

08:08 Read two chapters of *Learn Like a Pro*.

08:18 more practice with capitalize words

08:27 Another repetition on capitalize words and I'm better with it.

09:08 UI benefits certification website is down. Ugh.

09:42 So good to get those repetitions in to groove the procedural process.

10:55 Working on Arrays because I like it.

14:05 Finished KSS. It took a little longer and I got into a little tiff with SungOh because he wouldn't close and lock the front door after Damon arrived. I need to stay calm and not dismiss him like I did.

14:18 I apologized to SungOh for being short with him. I practiced the "Vocabulary" exercise form Arrays. I got it now, I think.

14:24 Ready to take a quick shower.

14:43 Body still itches from the poison ivy. Ugh.

16:01 So tired right now. I need a nap or a walk. Go for a walk now.

17:18 Finished with Arrays!

17:40 Read chapter of *The Pragmatic Programmer*.

## 20210804 수요잏

06:01 Waiting for Alex. I'm tired and could go back to bed. The birds chirp loudly.

07:22 Wrapping up study session with Alex.

08:02 Decided to wait to do KSS until after my interview. Started reading *Learn Like a Pro* chapter on testing, but decided to read it later. Now reading *A Mind for Numbers*.

08:33 My stomach itches so much. It feels good instantaneously to itch. Why? I added some hydrocortisone, but I have calamine lotion on my brain.

09:16 I have to pee.

09:50 Where did the time go? I got dressed up with a button down shirt and pants and I took a poo. I did check email, Slack, Messages, and WhatsApp.

10:46 Feeling antsy before the interview. I want to get it over with at this point. Ugh. I think I want to go to the gym today, maybe?

12:08 Interview is over and I think it went well. Vishwas had such a poker face, it was hard to tell how my answers landed.

14:13 After a walk, food and nap. Ready to study some more. I'm still itching even though I rubbed some Topicort and hydrocortisone on itchy body parts. Ugh.

14:51 Able to work pretty quickly through Greet 1, 2 and 3. Chalk came for the kettlebells which SungOh ripped open and spilled onto the couch. I'm tired but trying out chalk gives me a little motivation to train after my study session with Laurent.

16:11 Did two exercises with Laurent where he was driving the entire way and I was trying to keep up with his work. Good to watch him work.

16:13 Time to do KSS with chalk today!

16:33 Now going to do KSS.

16:43 I feel more invigorated to train now. Hmm.

17:22 Finished KSS and it feels good to read while stretching.

20:18 After putting the kids to bed. I feel itchy and have put on calamine lotion. It's all over my body and my clothes.

## 20210805 목요일

08:18 I feel tired this morning. I slept until around 7:30, two hours later than usual. Things are simmering in my brain. My body still itches from the poison ivy. What about my massage? When to take the quiz. Behind? I thought the Encora interview went well for me yesterday. We shall see. All is well.

08:51 After family breakfast, I'm at the dining room table about to read *Learn Like a Pro*.

   * Overall, feeling tired and lower energy lately. I haven't played soccer this week because of my hamstring, so not getting enough exercise.

10:00 Practiced 'Calculate Cat Age' exercise. It took around 20 minutes. Taking a short break and then coming back for the next exercise. I need more calamine lotion on my legs and arms.

10:23 Practiced 'Remove Last Char' exercise. I understand `String.prototype.substring()`.

10:32 Now I can just laugh when I encounter something that I don't know how to do in programming and then let the anxiety wash away before trying some shit.

10:53 Finished Function 2 a little early!

11:45 Back to programming after a break for email and some videos. I still itch in my abdomen area. Ugh.

11:55 Able to practice and complete 'Retrieve a Value (Part 1)' in ten minutes.

12:52 Working through Objects now.

13:03 Family is eating lunch, so I will take a break and sit with them.

13:52 In my siesta time, I checked email and have another interview with the CEO of Encora on Monday. It looks good for getting the job. Just about ready for KSS.

14:57 Finished KSS in 39:07 because I took shorter rests and also didn't do QL straddle which I don't like because it's painful and I want a better alternative. I'm going to shower now. My face is itching again. Ugh. Read some from the *Pragmatic Programmer* while stretching. They say learn a new language and start reading a new book after this one.

15:21 Rinsed off and put the Tecnu? stuff all over and buzzed my hair a little. Feel itchy in a few spots. Ugh.

15:51 Humming along through the Objects exercises in JavaScript Basics. I've got three more to do, but the study session starts soon.

17:27 Playing with the code after the code after the study session. I need to learn the different array methods.

19:01 After dinner, vacuuming and listening to the latest Launch School podcast episode.

19:39 Practiced "Convert an object to a nested array" using `Object.entries()`.

19:52 Late to putting the kids to bed. I still mildly itch in a few spots.

09:21 Ready to review JS101 Lesson 2.

11:04 Taking a break for correspondence. I'm going to sit outside and see if the fuzebug gadget works.

11:08 I think the fuzebug is a dud. I sat outside and the mosquito had no interest in the fuzebug. Ugh.

11:26 Taking a pee break and then back to studying before I train.

11:32 Still itchy all over.

13:15 Studied JS101 Lesson 2 into implicit type coercion. Taking a break to train in soccer skills and KSS.

13:32 Finished 10 Minute Ball Mastery Workout. Itchy on my belly right now. What is the resistance to training with kettlebells? Body doesn't want to do the work? My belly has gotten bigger without weekday soccer and I've gained weight. Ugh.

14:21 I feel so much better after training in soccer and with kettlebells. Now I'm going to eat something and then take a cold bath. I might do a little more studying before I go to see Dr. Riotto for some treatment on my hamstring. Yippee!

17:06 Dr. Riotto says to take a steroid for the poison ivy, so I asked Sohee to get a Rx. My nipples it right now and my eyes feel dried out from rubbing them.

19:00 After dinner of Francesca's and I'm closer to 95% full.

10:35 Reviewing JS101 Lesson 2 and realize I don't remember most of what I read. Active recall. Active recall. Come on!

10:40 It even says this isn't a linear learning process. I have to poo and then thinking about going into the basement to study as I haven't done that yet.

10:56 At the dining room table now.

11;44 Short rest with eyes closed and ready to do block scope.

12:30 Taking a break to read *A Mind for Numbers* and then make lunch. I've got a little more left in Lesson 2 to review and then I'll be ready to take the Lesson 2 Quiz 1 later today. Then I'll have next week to work on exercises. Fun stuff.

13:40 After lunch and dropping Omi off at McKenzie's for a play date. I thought about getting a foot massage, but didn't. Oh, I do need new cleats. Time to go shopping online.

15:26 Took a break this afternoon for a nap and some reading and surfing on the internet. Ready to study some more with active recall!

16:43 In the Coding Tips 2 section and there's some dense material here regarding not mutating the caller during iteration.

17:21 Finished review of JS101 Lesson 2. Ready to make dinner. Maybe take the quiz after dinner, maybe not. I need to look at RPS bonus features. There's some good stuff to learn.

18:29 After dinner. I don't want to take the quiz right now, but I do want to do some small problems.

07:52 Going to keep reading *The Book of Life* by J. Krishnamurti.

07:55 Going to read *A Mind for Number* book now. I seem to have abandoned the audible book because it's not a great book for audio as there are a lot of images and exercises not best suited for audio alone. I think as a video course it's fine or a book.

08:36 After breakfast and I might start studying earlier than planned.

09:41 I changed my mind and decided to prep for the interview first and then do my training.

11:14 Ugh. This guy Elias is not good at his job. Maybe interview will be tomorrow.

## 20210810 화요일

07:54 오늘 휴가라서 작업을 많이 안 해. No daily scrum. But I want to do an exercise or so.

10:51 Working on Question 2. Ready to go to the water park.

13:18 Happy to have a break to do some more coding. Looking at `Array.prototype.forEach()`.

15:28 Took a short nap and SungOh screaming at me for eating his Cheetos woke me up. Sohee returning from finding out about the Escape Room.

20:08 Working on another exercise, but everyone is going to sleep and I don't want to keep typing on the keyboard.

## 20210811 수요일

08:03 Looking at code now. How to flatten an array methods.

08:40 Practice using `Array.prototype.reduce()` to flatten a nested array. Fun. I still don't completely understand it yet.

11:56 Fun doing the ropes course with Omi. It looks like I will have an interview with Kevin Yeom, the VP of Engineering for the DXP Division of Encora on Friday.

12:12 Practice using `Array.prototype.flat()`.

12:22 Finished Question 5 after Question 6.

15:40 Working on Question 7 using `Object.entries(flintstones).filter(pair => pair[0] === 'Barney').shift();`

20:28 Just finished Question 8. I'm glad to go home tomorrow and work at home. I want to try the 90 minutes of Ultradian work with a 20 minute nap or non-sleep deep rest (diffuse mode).

## 20210812 목요일

07:08 Good morning. I want to go home and I want to go to the gym and deadlift and squat and hip thrust today.

12:45 Finished Easy 3. It had only five questions.

14:18 Back from the gym. It felt great to train heavier than I have been with kettlebells. I want to go everyday!

14:46 Ordered hot pink New Balance cleats because they were out of the black ones. Fun times on the pitch.

15:18 Starting Practice Problems: Medium 1.

20:33 Working on some problems on the couch while watching Shark Tank. Not the best situation.

11:51 I feel irritated by SungOh's watching Unspeakable on youtube.com.

12:38 I feel a disrespect from Sohee about my time. Is that on me? Ugh. I don't want this job. I want to keep studying Launch School fulltime. Ugh.

12:58 I don't understand everything happening in Question 3. It's only a few lines of code, so break it down. Practice, practice, practice. I need to take a break and prep for the interview with Kevin Yeom, VP of Engineering at Encora.

15:41 The interview went longer than expected and included many more questions than I thought I would get. So I have another interview with the Division CEO now. I haven't done any more coding and that annoys me. I'm going to see Dr. Riotto and then will come back and do some more programming and my soccer skills practice later.

16:49 Back from Dr. Riotto's and the house is empty. I want to trim my hair.

17:38 Working on Question 3 some more. Getting more repetitions.

10:41 After so many things. I had the SPOT study session, I had breakfast with the kids. We went for a walk. I went to the gym and did soccer drills and some light lifting. I took a shower.

06:12 Ugh. Just take the time to learn Git!

06:42 Slow and steady work through JavaScript collections. This material is partially review but it goes into much more depth.

06:57 I am typing out the notes as I go. More recall. More active recall. More practice.

07:07 Took a slightly longer ten minute break to poo and get coffee. I'm ready to study for at least another 25 minutes. I realize I need to do soccer drills while moving not just around a stationary cone. Duh.

16:17 Took a long break and read news on iPad which I liked doing a lot.

20:18 After putting the kids to bed, I'm working on the last video for the PEDAC lesson on coding with intent.

20:30 Time to relax with Sohee and watch some television.
I didn't quite finish Assignment 6 in Lesson 4.

map, filter, forEach

14:34 I just woke up from a short nap. I'm still kind of sleepy and tired. Maybe I need to go for a walk before doing daily scrum and weekly sprint stuff?

07:27 Once again, I slept in and missed my morning study window. I guess it's much harder without an accountability study partner. Ugh. I want to get outside this morning and make sure to get morning sunlight into my eyes after breakfast and before marriage counseling. Is there anything I want to discuss in counseling for today's session? I have to poo. All is well. Today is going to be a great day.

08:57 I went for a walk along the back trail of the duck pond and met and talked to Ray who lives at the house with the Tibetan prayer flags. I also saw a fox before that at the entrance. An eastern european heritage woman told me I was brave for walking barefoot there on the trail. Met a korean older couple who remarked that there had been a lot of rain. Just in a short walk this morning.

10:04 Kind of felt like the marriage counseling session this morning was a waste of time. Leidy's okay, but not that smart. Arrogance on my part?

12:56 Studying now and wearing headphones because the kids are home and SungOh is watching that insipid youtube show unspeakable. Why am I feeling irritated? I am not expressing what I really want. I want to study Launch School full-time now. The end. Yep.

13:08 Listening to The Wong Janice: "The Chakras: A Deep Cello Journey".

13:49 Finished sorting and need to poo. Going to try the increase cortisol and epinephrine and then do a N/NSDR protocol now.

3. Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?
   * I feel tired and a little burnout. I don't want to do Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective or Sprint Planning. I extended the duration of the last sprint to two weeks. Why don't I want to do this? Incentive?

19:41 Worked on Example 4. I skipped Sprint stuff today. I might pick it up tomorrow as I realize I don't review the stuff in my backlog otherwise. Time to go up and do bedtime with the kids.

## 20210906 월요일

14:30 It's Labor Day and I don't know what I'll study.

16:54 Tired and lazy day hanging out on the couch and watching tennis.

17:14 Studying a little before dinner.

17:23 Time to make dinner.

18:30 After dinner and I feel tired.

19:46 Finished Assignment 4. Working with Callback Functions, but I definitely need to go back and review it.

## 20210907 화요일

10:54 Wasted time trying to figure out why VS Code changed my default terminal shell from zsh to bash. It seems to be correct now. I still haven't done sprint stuff. I want to do Daily Scrum Questions and then study before I go to the gym.

3. Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?
   * Motivation for Launch School has dipped. I need to prioritize finding a job as my unemployment benefits drop $300 a week after the conclusion of the federal stimulus bonus.

11:14 Just having a hard time starting to study today. Why? Noisy with SungOh and Damon playing, but what else?

12:31 Terminal shell is defaulting to bash and it's driving me nuts. I've wasted a lot of time today trying to change it back to zsh and it seems to not work. Why did VS Code do that upon update?

12:50 I think I have the shell I want now. Ugh.

13:20 It's taken me forever to finish one problem today.

13:42 I finished problem two with a lot of glancing. But I'm making progress.

14:35 It looks like I will get into a SPOT study session today. Yeah. Time to take a break for 20 minutes.

16:00 Finished SPOT study session with Austin Miller, Marcos and Jeff had to drop. It was helpful.

16:50 I didn't understand what Guardrail does.

16:53 Legs feel tired. I'm going to take a short walk around the block now, I think.

17:29 Irritated by being called out for bad play in Louis's post-game segment when that's not accurate.

17:58 Working on Problem 4 before dinner.

19:11 SungOh and I went for a bike ride to Ridgewood High School and saw that the stadium field has mud all over it and the fence has leaves stuck in it halfway up.

20:18 Working on more practice problems while watching the US Open women's quarterfinal match.

20:47 Finished Practice Problem 6.

21:14 Finished Practice Problem 7 and done for the day.

## 20210908 수요일

07:40 Woke up late after going to bed late and didn't study in the morning. It's a school day, so have to serve breakfast to the kids and then walk them to school before I go to the gym to do soccer skills practice and athletic performance training.

10:52 Back from the gym. It's Mickey's birthday today. Send him a message? It's eerily quiet without SungOh at home.

11:59 Gosh it took a while to get to this point where I can now dedicate one Ultradian cycle of 90 minutes to programming.

12:26 Finished Practice Problem 8, but it took me 25 minutes to do after seeing the solution. I could reproduce it perfectly the next time which means my brain is working better at remembering code. Yes!

13:01 Taking me about 25 minutes to solve these simple problems. I'm okay. Got it.

13:28 Finished first pass at Practice Problem 10. I need to study that one again and again. I also need to dig into the details of `Array.prototype.sort`. Time for a lunch break.

14:10 I want to do one more problem before leaving to get the kids. This is after a short lunch break.

14:31 I am definitely going to have to study these practice problems again.

14:45 Time to get the kids.

15:45 Working on the rest of Practice Problem 12.

15:50 Back on my MBP on the La-Z-Boy. That word is in the dictionary. Amazing.

## 20210909 목요일

08:29 Sohee drove the kids to school and will go to her appointment with Leidy. We plan to have sex later so I'm excited. It seems if I don't have a study session scheduled or a soccer game in the morning, I sleep in. I've also been staying up until around 22:30 watching the US Open tennis matches. I'm going to read for a few minutes and then go to the gym. I love my family. It's the best thing about being alive.

11:17 Correspondence taking longer than 15 minutes.

11:42 Done with correspondence and now I'll take a short break before working on Practice Problems.

12:18 Practiced Practice Problem 13 and that took about 30 minutes. I still don't fully understand it. Go into diffuse mode for a break now.

12:50 It takes me about 30 minutes per problem right now. Going to play ping pong now.

20:16 I didn't do anymore studying and I don't feel like doing more right now. Ugh.

## 20210910 금요일

12:08 I'm ready for 90 minutes of focused studying to finish Practice Problems 15 ~ 17 now.

12:17 Finishing up the solution notes to Practice Problem 14. Now on to 15. Do I want a low level of white noise or is the chirp of cicadas and the breeze in the trees sufficient? Let's just keep studying for now as is.

12:45 Finished Practice Problem 15, but needed to look at the solution.

13:09 Practiced Practice Problem 16 with help from the solution. Easy way: `Object.fromEntries()`.

13:15 Practice Problem 17 feels too hard at the moment. I'm basically copying it into my notes. I'll look at it again later.

18:59 It's the start of movie night. Watching Pixels again. Ugh. Okay, I have to pee.

## 20210911 토요일

10:09 Back from soccer. I want to adjust my schedule based on what I heard in the Huberman Lab podcast about the best time to do focused work being 4 to 6 hours after your temperature minimum. My temperature minimum is about two hours before I wake up. If I wake up at 5:15 then my temperature minimum occurs around 3:15 and my best working window is between 7:15 to 9:15 to start.

11:24 Back from soccer match which we tied 2-2. Ugh.

## 20210913 월요일

07:48 I got up late. I thought I wanted to sleep in because of my tired body which is tired, but my mind was awake at 5:15 and even before and I could have gotten up and going then. Oh well. What do I really want? I want to complete Launch School's core curriculum and do a Capstone Project and then get a $150,000 per year job. That's what I want.

08:50 Back from walking the kids to school. I had a brisk walk back home. The middle of my right hamstring feels strained today.

08:58 I want a paper stand for studying. But I am committed to my 90 minutes starting at 9:00.

   * Iterating a new schedule this week. I want to follow Ultradian study cycles of 90 minutes. I want to complete three a day. I missed the early morning one, but could have gotten up to do it.

09:06 Lesson 5 Quiz 1 is on my agenda for this morning.

09:46 Just finished Lesson 5 Quiz 1 as follows:

Assignment: Lesson 5 Quiz 1
Student Name: HyoSung Bidol-Lee
Submitted at: less than a minute ago
Time taken: 0.55 hour(s)
Score: 5/7 (71.43%)

09:54 Start compiling written assessment answer snippets. Or wait until I finish JS101? I can't decide at the moment. Of course, I'm going to return to the quizzes.

10:43 Done reviewing Lesson 5 Quiz 1. I'm going to transition to correspondence and then go to the gym to train.

11:28 I changed my schedule and am starting Lesson 6 now. I plan to leave for the gym in a few minutes, but I'm thinking I may sit down at the kitchen table and study there. Not sure that I want to make the trip to the gym since I'm going to play ping pong with Louis and go for a swim.
Decisions. Decisions. Good problem to have. I'm going to the dining room table now as my legs feel fatigued.

11:46 Working on Lesson 6 > Assignment 2. More Node Debugger Commands. Enjoying this.

12:01 Studied Debugger and REPL stuff.

05:35 Study Session with Alex

Example

Examine the code example below. The last line outputs the string 'Hi' rather than the string 'Hello'. Explain what is happening here and identify the underlying principle that this demonstrates.

```js
let greeting = 'Hello';

while (true) {
  greeting = 'Hi';
  break;
}

console.log(greeting);
```

The global variable `greeting` is declared on line 1 and assigned to the string 'Hello'. Lines 3 to 6 define a `while` loop that will execute if the condition is `true`. In the loop, the greeting variable is reassigned to 'Hi'. The next line `break` ends the loop. `console.log` is called with the value of the variable `greeting` passed to it as an argument. 'Hi' gets output to the console. This example demonstrates variable scoping where variables declared in the outer scope are accessible from an inner scope.

global variable
variable scoping concept - inner and outer scope
while loop is infinite
reassignment of the variable
what's output by console.log

```js
// What gets logged and why?
let words = [
  ['hunter', 'spear'],
  ['gatherer', 'sack'],
];

function pluralize(array) {
  return array.map((words) => {
    words[0] += 's';
    words[1] += 's';
    return words;
  });
}

pluralize(words);
console.log(words);
```

The global variable `words` is declared and initialized to a nested array. The function `pluralize` is declared with one parameter that takes the local variable `array` as its argument. The function `pluralize` is invoked on line x. On line x, the map method iterates over the `array` with the local variable `words` which shadows the global variable `words`. `map` uses the callback function to transform the nested words array's elements with the [] operator by concatenating the element ...

07:00 I bit the bullet and clicked through to the JS109 Course. I'm ready to organize myself for the written assessment.

07:09 Write out the methods in my own words.

08:18 [Sergio's JS109 Live Interview Practice Problems](https://laced-october-d29.notion.site/Sergio-s-JS109-Live-Interview-Practice-Problems-1711ca8524f24918b4d6b6005934bb74)

10:33 the After Midnight (Part 1) was difficult for me. I need to look at it again more closely. Time for Daddy-Daughter Time with Omi now.

13:50 I reviewed After Midnight (Part 1) and I think I understand the math better now.

14:49 Starting Small Problems > Easy 6

16:02 Finished Easy 6 > 3. Reverse Number

18:56 Back from dinner at the Kim's. Good to see them. Ready to keep studying.

19:45 Putting the kids to bed.

20:13 Working on another problem.

20:44 I've officially completed over 1/2 of the Small Problems.

21:10 Grinding through problems, but need to review them later.

## 20211108 월요일

09:07 Going to work on more problems today. I decided to abandon my application to the Coinbase Apprenticeship Program as I made a mistake and started the coding challenge before breakfast. Ugh. Then I had to take the kids to school. I'm alright right now.

10:05 Just finished Easy 6 > 8. Sequence Count.

11:48 Time to go to PT. I can't figure out what's wrong with my code for "Reversed Array".

14:20 I finished Easy 6 with a few minutes left to spare from yesterday's plan. Wow, I did 12 problems in 24 hours. That's great and means I'm getting better and faster at solving problems.

14:39 I totally got confused with the output.

16:16 Into and reviewing List Processing. Here we go.

19:13 Finished 4. Leading Substrings

19:41 Time for kids to go to bed.

21:10 Getting tired. End of daylight savings messing with my head.

## 20211109 화요일

08:19 Time to study more small problems.

09:58 I stopped doing daily scrum and sending my answers to Alex. Ugh. I'm still making progress though.

11:05 Practicing many times with different versions of JS101 - Small Problems > String and Text Processing > 2. Delete Vowels.

11:10 On to the next problem. 3. Lettercase Counter.

11:32 I had to peek at the answer for the above problem.

13:30 I finished counts object problem. At Wayne Valley and need to get ready to referee.

18:45 I haven't written a note since before reffing?

21:15 Working through problems.

22:30 I need to learn regex better and better.

22:54 I need to stop and go to sleep. I finished the first pass through String and Text Processing.

## 20211110 수요일

09:06 Working on the Small Problems of Medium difficulty. Also, want to respond to Mel's Slack post. I replied to Mel and sent her the Launch School answer. I'm not sure that it helps, but okay.

11:24 I spend a lot of time on Medium 1 > 2. Rotation (Part 2).

11:48 Difficult to discern the logic of Medium 1 > 3. Rotation (Part 3). Now it's time to go to PT.

17:19 Working on Stack Machine Interpretation that has a long explanation.

19:03 Feeling quite tired right now doing Medium 1 > 4. Stack Machine Interpretation

## 20211111 목요일

08:42 Working on Small Problems > Medium 2

13:36 I did back to back study sessions and still can't solve the problems on my own yet. Time to take a short break and then come back to more problems.

14:41 Starting to slowly recognize patterns and methods to use for patterns.

16:54 I can't figure out the problem that I got from Miles at the SPOT study session. Frustrating.

18:11 Time for dinner

20:08 Need help to solve these problems.

21:11 Another confusing problem.

22:00 Tired and confused right now with these small problems of medium difficulty.

## 20211112 금요일

08:15 Dreaming about the small problems and waking up to see if I can figure out the solution to the problem that Miles gave me yesterday.

08:55 Laurent can study, so I'm going to ask him for help.

11:21 Did a few problems with Laurent and realize that I really need to drill more basic methods for fluency. Going to PT now. Omi is home alone.

14:50 Repeating the medium problems from study groups. Time to get SungOh.

17:30 At the Aaron Kim's birthday party where SungOh is running around.

## 20211113 토요일

12:25 Grinding through the Small Problems for a second time today.

19:51 I have worked on Small Problems all day and am working through Easy 2 > Convert a Number to a String. I think I'm going to have to go through some of these at least three times.

21:05 I see why I want to do these small problems multiple times.

## 20211114 일요일

10:57 Starting to study after soccer game which we won 4-1.

20:12 Worked through Small Problems > Easy 3 two times. I still need to study some of the problems again.

## 20211115 월요일

10:10 Working on Easy 4 problems and getting breaking down the Palindromic Strings (Part 2).

11:51 I will need to pass through these problems again and again. Time to go to PT.

14:44 Still confused out of my mind a little bit. Alas, I'm slowly understanding. Time to go to school and get the kids on Monday afternoon.

22:10 I feel like I'm working too slowly through the problems again.

## 20211116 화요일

08:14 Time to study after I check on my checks for BCSOA.

09:10 Reviewed Joe's severance agreement. Deposited checks. Certified for UI benefits. Time to study now and get ready for the study group.

11:56 I spent hours on that single problem from the study group to now.

13:38 Doing the repetitions on the small problems. Time to take a short break and move to the dining room table.

16:41 How long have I been working on how many problems? Yikes, I didn't keep track of the last commit. Commit after each solution to keep track of how long it takes, but is that mastery-based? It's not not mastery-based in that mastery-based learning doesn't state that you can't keep track of time.

17:20 About 40 minutes on After Midnight Part 1.

17:30 Read through and copied the code for After Midnight 2 and that took ten minutes.

17:58 Finished Double Char Part 1 before dinner.

19:38 Working on Double Char Part 2 for a long time. Now, it's time to put the kids to bed.

19:40 I do think I am building fluency and figuring out more quickly how to fix my mistakes. Eyes are tired right now though.

19:53 Worked on Reverse Number and that went more quickly. Now go up for kids' bedtime.

20:10 Starting Easy 6 > 4. Get The Middle Character.

21:10 Wow, I spent one hour on that problem. I worked my own solution and then looked at other submitted solutions and then went back and worked my solution again.

21:17 Got my Easy 6 > 5. Always Return Negative working in a matter of minutes by tinkering. Keep on tinkering.

21:28 Now on to Easy 6 > 6. Counting Up, but I'm tired.

21:33 Got a working solution in just a few minutes.

21:49 Stopping for tonight.

## 20211117 수요일

08:49 Back from dropping off the kids and before starting a study session with Laurent.

08:58 Getting ready for study session.

## 20211118 목요일

09:04 Working on one problem for about 40 minutes. Then just found out that Omar's dad died in Cairo, Egypt. Going to my standing desk after I make this commit.

10:30 Working through the three List Processing problems > 4. Leading Substrings, 5. All Substrings, and 6. Palindromic Substrings. That took about 90 minutes with lots of help from the discussion section.

12:59 I need to practice and practice and practice problems more and more.

18:25 Grinding through more problems. Still not fluent.

21:05 So much to learn.

## 20211119 금요일

08:53 Digesting the problem from Antonina from yesterday.

09:24 Reviewed and practiced the JS109 Study Group problem from yesterday and understand it better now.

11:53 I'm back from PT and getting ready for the PEDAC study session with Antonina.

13:44 After PEDAC session. I got lost put was able to put the finishing touch on the code at the end.

14:28 I understand problems after I see them, not before.

14:49 I do enjoy working on these problems. It's almost time to go to school and get the kids.

16:55 Hanging out with SungOh before TV time. I want to do more studying.

17:14 Get comfortable with the confusion.

18:45 Time to stop studying and watch The Prisoner of Azkaban.

22:23 Reading through and copying the code for the fibonacci problems. Time to go to bed.

## 20211121 일요일

16:00 Back from the Career Ministry Resources meeting and want to code. I made Anki cards of many of the medium problems yesterday and want to make more, so I have a place where I can keep seeing the types of problems even if I can't actually code out solutions.

17:00 Took medium problems I found in my study sessions and put them in my Medium-Problems folder and I think I have most of them in Anki.

17:12 My legs are tired. I still have problems with finding solutions.

## 20211122 월요일

08:58 Back from walking the kids to school and now will have to get a bar for the kids.

09:14 Organizing my files in the JS109 folder. Now I have to go get this bar.

12:25 Grinding through Small Problems > Easy 1 and Easy 2 this morning. I have to poo again. Yikes. They do seem easier this time around, but there are still little things like how `slice` works with a negative index as an offset from the last element. So `slice(0, -1)` returns the element from the beginning to the second-to-last element. It doesn't include the last element. Also, don't forget to `toUpperCase()` or `toLowerCase()` when necessary.

13:51 Stopping to go and play ping pong with Louis.

19:02 I've been working on Easy 2 problems this afternoon and now before bedtime. I get frustrated and then take a break to let the diffuse mode take over and then it does seem easier to recall. My eyes feel strained though.

21:02 Slow and steady through the Small Problems a third time.

21:25 Stopping studying to watch Insecure with Sohee.

## 20211123 화요일

08:25 Looked at Anki cards after meditation. Laurent wants to study today. That's good.

09:21 Still need to keep practicing maybe even more reps than I think. Memorization is necessary. Almost time for study session with Laurent.

11:42 Did two problems with Laurent. He's good.

11:50 Time to leave for PT. I think my studying is paying dividends.

14:21 Refactoring some code. Practicing `maxMultiple` several times with different variations.

14:34 Moving to the couch to get ready to watch Chelsea vs Juventus in Champions League group play.

19:31 Still working on Small Problems > Easy 3 > 10. What Century Is That? A problem that stymies me a little bit still.

20:54 I'm tired and going to stop studying for tonight although I might look at some Anki cards.

## 20211124 수요일

08:52 I walked the kids to school and SungOh complained because he wants to drive to school. I have a study session with Laurent at 09:00. My brain can't keep the Anki small problems in my mind at the moment. More practice, I need. My toes are cold.

14:01 After the holiday concert for SungOh and getting the kids and making lunch. I have a little time to study some more. Laurent is quite good with problem-solving. I need to review what we did today.

14:53 I am getting this stuff slowly and surely.

20:38 Everyone has left and I have a few minutes before the study group starts.

22:36 Worked on validParentheses problem from the study group. I needed help to solve it. I need help to solve most problems.

## 20211125 목요일

10:50 Thanksgiving morning and I want to keep coding.

12:08 It took me forever with a lot of help to finish 'Cute Angles'.

18:25 Been programming throughout Thanksgiving. Gaining more fluency and confidence.

19:20 Almost time to leave. Working on Easy 5.

## 20211126 금요일

08:59 Awake and looking at code.

12:02 Studying on and off for the last three hours. Some problems seem so much easier the third time around and others still seem hard. Use PEDAC. It's my friend.

12:24 Time to get our Christmas tree and lunch.

13:52 We got a nice tree from Home Depot and lunch from McDonald's. Back to coding before my PT appointment.

14:21 Doing variations on Valid Parentheses problem. I see how knowing more can make your code more concise.

14:49 Learning more about using `pop()` which removes the last element of an array and returns that element.

```js
function swapName(fullName) {
  let splitNames = fullName.split(' ');
  return `${splitNames.pop()}, ${splitNames.join()}`
}

console.log(swapName('Joe Roberts')); // "Roberts, Joe"
console.log(swapName('Karl Oskar Henriksson Ragvals')); // "Ragvals, Karl Oskar Henriksson"
```

16:29 Back from PT.

21:34 We watched the rest of The Goblet of Fire for movie night and I'm cranking away at Small Problems > Easy 6. Reversing an array in place still gives me a little trouble.

22:05 Through Easy 6 for a third time. I'll do List Processing tomorrow. Definitely need to do Medium Problems again. Not sure about the Easy ones.

## 20211127 토요일

08:52 Just before breakfast. Look at some code.

```js
function compare(a, b) {
  if (a is less than b by some ordering criterion) {
    return -1; // place `a` before `b`
  }
  if (a is greater than b by the ordering criterion) {
    return 1; // place `b` before `a`
  }
  // a must be equal to b
  return 0; // keep `a` and `b` in the same order
}
```

12:34 Dang, Michigan intercepted at the goal line.

## 20211128 일요일

14:19 More studying. Learn and learn and learn and get better.

15:06 Finished List Processing for the third time. I still have some issues with how to do some things. On the road to mastery though.

16:44 Taking a long time to iterate through each problem, but I think I am understanding them better and better.

19:38 Time to put the kids to bed. The `String.prototype.toUpperCase` and `String.prototype.toLowerCase` methods handle both alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters.

22:30 Practiced up to Medium Problems a third time. I might have to do some of the problems a fourth time.

## 20211129 월요일

09:11 Home with SungOh because he didn't feel well and is not going to school today.

16:43 I probably unnecessarily revised my PEDAC template and made it more verbose. Ugh.

19:06 A piece of code to memorize: `if (!Array.isArray(array)) return undefined;`

20:34

`Array.prototype.splice()`

The `splice()` method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place. To access part of an array without modifying it, see `slice()`.

```js

splice(start)
splice(start, deleteCount)
splice(start, deleteCount, item1)
splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, itemN)
```

21:03 Doing more testing / console.log of my code. This is good, so I know what is being returned at each step. Time to watch some TV with Sohee.

## 20211130 화요일

08:56 I haven't done daily scrum in a while. What about today? I need to get back to keeping track of my work.

09:15 Should I send this to Alex or not? It's a good reference point nonetheless. I have a plan for today.

09:34 I scheduled my Pomodoro and Eye Divergence timers again.

10:31 Starting JS109 Study Group.

11:34 I still suck at solving problems. Ugh. Help.

13:20 I need to memorize using nested loops:

```js
function getSubArrays(array) {
  let subArrays = [];

  for (let idx = 0; idx <= array.length; idx += 1) {
    for (let jdx = idx + 1; jdx <= array.length; jdx += 1) {
      subArrays.push(array.slice(idx, jdx));
      // console.log(subArrays);  [[-2], [-2, 1], [-2, 1, -3], [1], [1, -3], [-3]];
    }
  }

  return subArrays;
}
```

14:50 Still working on the JS109 Study Group problem. I want to do it again after a short break.

15:26 It took me hours to fully understand the `maxSequence` problem.

15:41 I need to burn this into my brain:

```js
function maxRotation(number) {
  let numberDigits = String(number).length;
  for (let count = numberDigits; count >= 2; count -= 1) {
    number = rotateRightmostDigits(number, count);
  }

  return number;
}

function rotateRightmostDigits(number, count) {
  let numberArray = String(number).split('');
  let element = numberArray.splice(numberArray.length - count, 1);
  return Number(numberArray.concat(element).join(''));
}
```

18:34 I need to prepare for the Solutions Engineer job interview with GitHub. I'm looking at my notes from the Catalogic experience. It's on GitHub.

## 20211201 수요일

07:53 Before breakfast with the kids and I have programming on my mind and preparing for the GitHub interview. I need to dissect the job description and assess my knowledge and skills of those bullet points.

08:52 Daily Scrum Questions

1. What did you do yesterday?
   * [x] 1. Practice Small Problems > Medium 1
     * [x] 1. Rotation (Part 2) - good to practice this one again and code out Laurent's solution as well

   * [ ] 2. Read PreSales Collective blogs on the hiring process
   * [ ] 3. Research GitHub features

3. Are there any blockers or impediments preventing you from doing your work?
   * None

12:43 Sort of on a lunch break. The morning went fast as I focused on research for the GitHub Solutions Engineer job interview that is tomorrow.

## 2021202 목요일

13:11 Get so good at something that I don't have to interview? The screening interview this morning went well, I think. I had already been advanced to the next round because of my relationship with Ravi.

14:26 Discouraged for a moment that I can't seem to figure out a problem that I've seen before. I need to sharpen my technical acumen and keep struggling.

15:45 Studied with Laurent who helped walk me through the `palindrome` problem.

## 2021203 금요일

11:08 I did a study session with Laurent. I have so much to learn. I'm fixing my filepath error in GitHub Learning Lab using Actions. Time to leave for PT in ten minutes.

## 20211204 토요일

08:37 Watching West Ham vs Chelsea and it's 1-2 at the start of the second half.

09:10 Just need to keep practicing problems.

09:38 More small problems practice and now ready to go to the American Girl store and the Lego Store in Manhattan with the family.

## 20211205 일요일

19:25 I reffed most of the day and am working on some small problems before the bedtime of the kids.

20:08 Watching Money Heist with Sohee.

## 20211206 월요일

05:56 Ready for study session with Alex.

09:03 I think I'm back to using the Productivity Planner today. I need to poo and then make my plan for today and this week. I see that Shikha Thakkar viewed my profile on LinkedIn.

11:34 Feeling anxious about the GitHub interview. When will it be scheduled. I have the interview prep session with Sebass tomorrow.

11:47 Take a break. For some reason, Mac OS didn't update.

12:42 The software update didn't execute. Do I dare try it now during a lunch break? I will try it now.

## 20211207 화요일

05:53 Worked more on CI with the GitHub Learning Lab, but I still can't get the last test to pass. That's 17/18. I have an interview prep meeting with Sebass van Boxel today at 12:00 and a study session with Alex in a few minutes.

07:30 I still don't fully understand the problem I did with Alex today. I need to repeat it a few more times.

08:33 TIL Stephanie Cunnane (Capstone)  22:12
TIL about the `$ npx npkill` command to remove all those `node_modules` folders floating around eating up your hard drive space. [Cool 39-second video about it:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOSH2pYg6m8&list=PL0vfts4VzfNigohKr5sPrkcPFpuZmTe2C&index=7)

## 20211208 수요일

05:51 Before study session with Alex, I feel okay. I want this interview with GitHub to get scheduled.

07:37 I want the GitHub interview to be scheduled.

12:28 Minutes before the JS109 study session.

## 20211209 목요일

05:53 Got up a little late this morning.

07:36 I can't seem to understand the letterChanges problem well.

16:13 Back from playing ping pong with Louis and ready to keep learning more about GitHub for my interview tomorrow.

## 20211210 금요일

07:25 After my study session with Alex. Getting slowly and steadily better at small problems.

07:48 Programming is learning the patterns and practicing them over and over.

17:08 The interview with Shikha went well and I want to do the technical screener soon.

## 20211212 일요일

10:30 Finished the medium problems a third time now. But I definitely have a bias against doing the difficult ones. Ugh.

## 20211213 월요일

09:42 Studying with Laurent after studying with Alex before breakfast.

10:54 Heading to the gym and not for PT for the first time in months, it seems like. I want to get explosive again.

## 20211214 화요일

06:03 Waiting on Alex to start the study session. I put the same problem that Laurent and I worked on yesterday in the replit.com.

19:25 I took some notes earlier today, right? Working through the problems in the order that Aaron Smith curated them. Still struggling with some things.

## 20211215 수요일

05:58 I got the technical screener from GitHub last night. I will work on it today and get a draft done. What problem to work on with Alex today?

06:28 Alex did not show up this morning. I'm looking at the "Take Home Test from GitHub" anyway.

06:56 Alex woke up late and that's okay. I printed out the GitHub take home test.

## 20211216 목요일

07:19 After study session with Alex.

## 20211217 금요일

Ginni Pinckert (TA)  23 minutes ago
If you go into the Settings under "Suggestions" there should be an option called "Accept Suggestion on Enter" which you can turn off.

18:10 Practice and more practice needed. I still want to work as a software engineer.

## 20211218 토요일

10:17 Going back to my practice problems. Do I want to study the Introduction to Regular Expressions book or wait until later in the core curriculum?

11:39 Practiced a couple of problems. Now going to the mall with the kids.

## 20211219 일요일

17:50 Practicing problems on and off this afternoon. Ugh. I need to push myself harder to solve problems before looking at the solution.

## 20211220 월요일

05:51 Good morning. Ready for another week of studying.

07:46 I can learn coding. Yes, I can pass the JS109 Interview Assessment. Get prepared and do it.

09:51 Looking at the videos on my laptop, but it's too small. I need to get to my iMac now.

12:28 Feeling some tension in my right wrist.

11:39 Slow and steady making progress.

13:08 The `commonChars` problem seemed very difficult to me. There must be a way to simplify it.

20:36 Tired. Still confused. That's okay. Keep going.

## 20211221 화요일

08:38 Missed studying with Alex this morning because he lost his router. I'm looking at the problems in Video 3 right now.

09:51 Followed along with substringTest problem from video 3.

11:32 Actually helpful to review the PEDAC materials from Lesson 4.

15:50 The PEDAC problem is hard for me. Go back to basics?

16:40 Not sure what to do right now? I'm thinking of doing the Small Problems again from the beginning. I think this would be my fourth time.

20:39 Just keep practicing. It will come.

## 20211222 수요일

07:05 I finished study session with Alex and I was mostly able to code a solution to a problem that I hadn't done before. That's progress.

08:25 Practice practice practice and time to go to school with the kids.

10:22 Shifting to standing work station to get ready for study session at 10:30.

10:29 Stating the obvious, but variable naming is critical for me to understand problems.

20:29 Studying medium problems.

## 20211223 목요일

07:51 After study session with Alex I feel more comfortable with a problem that confused me when I first saw it a few weeks ago.

07:55 Time for breakfast.

09:01 The little things are the things to keep track of when solving problems. My right elbow feels sore right now. Not good.

12:29 I figured out maxSequence without looking at the solution. Some things are sticking. Yes!

## 20211224 금요일

10:00 Christmas Eve and I played soccer this morning. I want to problem-solve today. I slept on `palindrome` and understand it better today.

14:17 Working on palindromeSubstrings today.

16:23 Today I feel like the bug and not the windshield while programming.

## 20211225 토요일

09:39 After opening Christmas presents. Back to studying.

`Array.prototype.lastIndexOf()`

The `lastIndexOf()` method returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. The array is searched backwards, starting at `fromIndex`.

10:03 Visualize nested loops:

```js
for (let idx = 0; idx < 3; idx += 1) {
  for (let jdx = 0; jdx < 6;  jdx += 1) {
    console.log(`${idx} ${jdx}`)
  }
}

// Output
0     0
0     1
0     2
0     3
0     4
0     5
1     0
1     1
1     2
1     3
1     4
1     5
2     0
2     1
2     2
2     3
2     4
2     5
```

The inner loop executes from start to finish for every iteration of the outer loop. A loop executes the entirety of the code within its body and repeats it until the running condition is made false.

From the output you can see that the value of `idx` only increases after the inner loop is finished running. The value of `jdx` goes from 0 to 5 for every + 1 increase in `idx`.

16:50 More studying of medium problems.

`Array.prototype.slice`

The `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from `start` to `end` (`end` not included) where `start` and `end` represent the index of items in the that array. The original array will not be modified.

```js
slice()
slice(start)
slice(start, end)
```

20:05 Tired and my eyes are sore.

## 20211226 일요일

19:29 Working on and off on the medium problems and finished going through them. I peeked at solutions quite a few times while practicing.

## 20211227 월요일

13:08 Feeling crappy today. I did practice `vowelCount` again though.

18:16 The index of the last element in an array will always be the length of that array minus 1.

`Array.isArray(words);  // true`

19:12 The `Date.now()` method returns the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

```js
let today = new Date();

today.getYear(); // deprecated
today.getFullYear();
```

The array method `join()` concatenates all elements of an array into a string. It expects a single, optional argument: a string that will be used as separator. If the argument is omitted, the separator defaults to ','. Any excess arguments passed to the method upon invocation are ignored.

```js
let array = ['Bob', 'Kevin', 'Stuart'];

// separator argument omitted
array.join();                  // 'Bob,Kevin,Stuart'

// single separator argument
array.join(', ');              // 'Bob, Kevin, Stuart'

// excess argument passed in
array.join(' and ', 'also');   // 'Bob and Kevin and Stuart'
```

```js
for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression]) {
  statement
}
```

06:05 Study session with Alex.

07:36 Back in the saddle working on medium problems. That's good. Left side of my neck and shoulders hurts. Ugh.

08:12 I need more and more practice to get the patterns down.

09:31 Getting ready for study session with Laurent. I put my stool on wood block, so it's the right height for my standing desk.

14:15 Doing 'String and Text Processing' small problems again and seeming to understand them better today.

19:41 Got kudos for my template study guide for the written from Jeff Lovell. Worked on more problems with Alex and Laurent and on my own.

## 20211229 수요일

06:01 Waiting for Alex to start study session.

08:52 More and more practice needed.

13:24 GitHub rejection email received earlier today.

19:20 Best thing to do when feeling rejected is to get back to studying which is what I am doing now.

19:44 Got to go up for the kids' bedtime.

20:38 Watch some tv with Sohee and go to bed.

## 20211230 목요일

05:52 Awake and ready to solve problems.

06:12 Alex talked to people in tech.

07:08 Finished study session with Alex. Looking at Multiples of 3 or 5 Codewars problem.

07:45 I solved the problem on my own. It's leveled as 6 kyu.

07:51 Reading "Solving Coding Problems with PEDAC" again and annotating it.

08:06 I just applied for the onramp Programs and Community Assistant position.

08:52 Find a problem for Laurent to do as practice for the interview assessment.

10:29 Got confused on coderpad solving a problem.

11:43 Alex called me and told me I need to get rid of my written assessment answers in GitHub.

12:23 I got sidetracked by adding to my `.gitignore` file.

12:45 I need to own the code. I need to know exactly what each variable is doing and what is happening. Own the code.

17:10 All over the place today. I need to get Omi in a few minutes.

19:55 Creating patterns file wear I comment on each line of code to confirm my understanding of what is happening. I also use `console.log` statements if I need to know the output at that stage. Time to put the kids to bed.

20:50 Shut it down for today.

## 20211231 금요일

09:35 Back from playing soccer and before my study session with Laurent. All is well.

10:01 Start study session with Laurent.

11:37 I gave Laurent a difficult problem that he's working on now.

11:57 Laurent figured out the second one. I'm tired from playing soccer and being a little under the weather.

12:58 After lunch and I feel pretty tired.

17:24 Breaking down problems and dissecting the solutions in code slowly.

21:59 Might be done for the night. Happy New Year 2022.

## 20220101 토요일

05:49 Happy New Year 2022! All is well. My meditation timer is running.

07:51 Alex was late but we did study together for about an hour.

## 20220102 일요일

15:07 Back after reffing this morning.

18:47 Working on JavaScript Basic problems.

20:33 `filter` and `forEach` seem to work similarly in some situations.

20:37 Keep practicing to be flawless with medium problems.

## 20220103 월요일

08:51 Before study session with Laurent. I started reading The Daily Laws by Robert Greene. What was my childhood obsession? Sports. Yes. How do I make that into a job now?

10:12 Laurent is ready for the interview assessment. I am not yet. I need to have resilience and figure out how to keep going when I am stuck. Practice, practice, practice.

10:50 I can do easy medium problems in a little over ten minutes. Getting closer to being ready for the interview assessment.

12:05 I did `Alphabet Score` again and it went better at around 15 minutes.

13:07 Note to self to practice "Alphabet Score" and "Common Chars" problems a few more times.

14:48 Keep practicing. I think some of the medium problems in my medium directory are not that difficult. Maybe it's because I understand them now. It's almost time to get the kids.

17:42 Also need to do `Count Matching Indices` again and again.

* [ ] Alphabet Score
* [ ] Common Chars
* [ ] Count Matching Indices

19:49 Out of the 9 medium problems I did today 3/9 were difficult. I need more practice.

20:32 I easily did "Difference of Two" problem from a recent study group. I remembered Antonina's solution and am more comfortable with switching between a for loop and `forEach`. Okay, time to watch "Ramy" with Sohee. See you tomorrow bright and early to study with Alex at 6:00.

## 20220104 화요일

09:00 I learned another way to do the `alphabetScore` problem with Alex this morning. Now certify or UI benefits and then do a study session with Laurent.

12:31 Another PEDAC study session with an easy problem that I got confused about how to code initially. I have an interview with EarthCam at 13:00 today and then more studying of medium problems.
