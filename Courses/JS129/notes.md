# Assessment JS129: Object Oriented Programming with JavaScript

## Assignment 1: Assessment Format

This assessment is in 2 parts:

1. a timed test that you can start whenever you are ready.
2. a 1-on-1 live coding interview using Zoom or Skype.

Not passing either part results in a "Not Yet" for this assessment. See the [Assessment Rules](https://launchschool.com/gists/99b650e4) for the policy on retakes.

### Part 1 - Test

The test contains a series of questions (around 20), and you will have **3 hours** to complete it. After you submit the exam, we'll grade it within 24 hours. We may ask you to revise your answers, even if you receive a high grade. After you submit acceptable revisions, the grader will send the test to the instructor for a final evaluation. The instructor will take a look at your initial answers and revised answers, and determine whether the work is sufficient to pass. The instructor will make a final evaluation within 24 hours of receiving the test from the grader. The entire process could take a few days, depending on how well you do on your original answers and how quickly you respond to requests for revisions.

If you pass, you can continue to the next course. If you receive a "Not Yet" evaluation, you must retake the test according to the retake policy shown in our Assessment Rules.

There is a study guide for the test that walks you through what you need to study and how you should prepare.

### Part 2 - Interview

Once you pass part 1, you'll receive instructions on scheduling a follow-up interview.

The interview will be conducted like a real job interview, except we'll only talk about topics covered in this course. Make sure that you're clear on the core concepts from the lessons, and that you're able to explain clearly with code examples during the interview. You'll be expected to describe concepts with precision and clarity, while at the same time providing code examples.

We'll conduct the interview using Zoom or Skype, along with a collaborative online editor. We'll primarily use CoderPad. You should practice using the CoderPad environment ahead of time by exploring the demo pad. This pad is set up for demonstration purposes only and won't be used for the interview. When you're done exploring the demo pad, make sure that you clear any changes you made so that it's ready for the next person to use.

There is a study guide for the interview that walks you through what you need to study and how you should prepare.
