## OOP Introduction

Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm that solves problems by organizing programs into objects that hold data as both state (properties) and behavior. The four basic principles of OOP are APIE: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of OOP

- Advantages
  - It lets programmers think about a problem at a higher-level of abstraction, which helps them break down and solve the problem.
  - OOP helps programmers write programs that reduce the *dependencies* in a program, which makes maintenance easier.
  - Done right, OOP makes code flexible, easy to understand, and easy to change.

- Disadvantages
  - OOP programs are often much larger than the equivalent procedural program.
  - OOP may lead to less efficient code; OO programs may require more memory, disk space, and computing power.

## 1. Objects, Object Factories (Factory Functions), Constructors and Prototypes, OLOO, and ES6 Classes

### 1.1 Objects

Objects are one of the eight fundamental types in JavaScript (String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Object, BigInt, and Symbol). They are basically a collection of properties where each property has a key and value. While values can be any of the JavaScript types, property keys are always strings. If you define a property with a non-string key, it will first be *converted to a string*.

```js
// Object literal syntax
let myObject = {};

myObject[false] = "one"
myObject[7] = "two"
myObject[[1, 2, 3]] = "three"

Object.keys(myObject);                // ["7", "false", "1,2,3"]

myObject["false"]                     // "one"
myObject["7"]                         // "two"
myObject["1,2,3"]                     // "three"
```

#### 1.1.1 Property Access

When dealing with objects, we are basically doing either one of two things: *setting a property* or *accessing a property*. We do both operations through the property key by using bracket notation or dot notation.

```js
myObject["foo"] = "bar";
myObject.foo     // "bar" using dot notation
myObject["foo"]  // "bar" using bracket notation
```

Dot notation is also called **member access notation**, while bracket notation is called **computed member access notation**. The main difference between the two is that bracket notation can take any UTF-8-compatible string as the key, while member access notation requires valid variable names. Most importantly, computed member access notation can be computed on the fly -- *any expression between the brackets gets evaluated as a string and used to reference the property*.

```js
myObject["a-key"] = 'four';

myObject.a-key // SyntaxError (a-key is not a valid variable name)
myObject["a-key"] // 'four'
myObject["a" + "-" + "key"] // 'four'
```

#### 1.1.2 Property Existence

If we *access a non-existent property on an object*, we get `undefined`. However, we also get the same value when we try to access a property that is explicitly set to `undefined`.

```js
Object.keys(myObject)  //  [ '7', 'false', '1,2,3', 'a-key' ]
myObject[undefinedKey] = undefined

myObject.undefinedKey // undefined
myObject.missingKey  // undefined
```

The `in` operator as well as `hasOwnProperty()` allow us to check for property existence in an object. Both methods check if a property exists in an object. If it does, `true` is returned, and `false` otherwise.

```js
Object.keys(myObject)  //  [ '7', 'false', '1,2,3', 'a-key' ]

"false" in myObject // true
"true" in myObject // false

myObject.hasOwnProperty('7') // true
myObject.hasOwnProperty('8') // false
```

Another *indirect way of checking for property existence* is to enumerate the properties of an object via `Object.keys` or `Object.getOwnPropertyNames`. Both return an array of the object’s properties. The difference is that `Object.keys` *returns an array of enumerable properties* while `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` *returns all properties* regardless if they’re enumerable or not.

```js
// `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's enumerable properties.
Object.keys(myObject) // [ '7', 'false', '1,2,3', 'a-key', 'undefinedKey' ]

// `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array of all properties regardless if they're enumerable or not.
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(myObject) // [ '7', 'false', '1,2,3', 'a-key', 'undefinedKey' ]
```

### 1.1.3 Property Existence Operator/Method Table

Operator/Method                | Own Property | Prototype Chain | Enumerable | Non-Enumerable
-------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------
`in`                           | Yes          | Yes             | Yes        | Yes
`hasOwnProperty()`             | Yes          | No              | Yes        | Yes
`Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` | Yes          | No              | Yes        | Yes
`Object.keys()`                | Yes          | No              | Yes        | No

### 1.1.5 Property Existence Examples

```js
let obj = {
  key1: "value1",
  key2: "value2",
}
// `Object.keys` is good for iterating over enumerable properties
let keys = Object.keys(obj)
console.log(keys) // =>  [ 'key1', 'key2' ]

// `hasOwnProperty`
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("key1")); // => true
console.log(keys.hasOwnProperty("length")); // => true
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("hasOwnProperty")); // => false

// `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` will return non-enumerable properties too
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)); // =>  [ 'key1', 'key2' ]
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(keys)); // =>  [ '0', '1', 'length' ]

// `in`
console.log("key1" in obj); // => true
console.log("length" in keys); // => true
console.log("hasOwnProperty" in obj); // => true
```

### 1.2 Object Factories / Factory Functions

One way to *automate the creation of objects* is to use the **factory function pattern**. A factory function returns an object with a particular set of methods and properties. The methods remain the same across the objects, while the property values can be customized by providing them as arguments. Factory functions instantiate and return a new object in the function body. They let us create new objects based on a predefined template.

#### 1.2.1 Advantages / Disadvantages of Factory Functions

- Advantages
  1. Reuse code (reduces repetitive code)
  2. Create objects that represent data of a specific type
  3. Allows for self-referential methods using the `this` keyword

- Disadvantages
  1. There is no way to inspect an object and learn whether we created it with a factory function.
     - That effectively *makes it impossible to identify the specific "type" of the object*; at best, you can only determine that an object has some specific characteristics.
     - Not compatible with the `instanceof` operator to determine type.

  2. Every object created with a factory function has a full copy of all the methods. That's **redundant**, and it can place a heavy load on system memory.

#### 1.2.2 Factory Function Example 1 - `createCar`

```js
function createCar(make, model, year) {
  return {
    make,         // Same as "make: make"
    model,        // Same as "model: model"
    year,         // Same as "year: year"
    started: false,

    start() {     // Same as "start: function() {"
      this.started = true;
    },

    stop() {      // Same as "stop: function() {"
      this.started = false;
    },
  };
}

let car1 = createCar('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
let car2 = createCar('Honda', 'Civic', 2017);

// my addition
let car3 = createCar('Tesla', 'Model X', 2022);
```

The `createCar` function takes three arguments and returns a car object with four properties and two methods. With this `createCar` **object factory**, you can create as many car objects as your program needs. In this case, `createCar` handles the similarities, while each invocation specifies the differences with arguments.

Factory functions give us the ability to create objects of the same type by merely calling a function. Entities that are common to multiple objects, such as the `start` and `stop` methods, get declared in one place. On the other hand, *arguments are passed to the factory function* to distinguish one object from another, such as the `make`, `model`, and `year`. Some entities, like `started`, don't fall easily into either category, but that's not important here.

**Compact Method Syntax (concise syntax)** - omits the `:` and the `function` keyword and uses parenthesis to denote a method.

#### 1.2.3 Factory Function Example 2 - `createPerson`

```js
// longer version of creating a factory function
function createPerson(firstName, lastName = '') {
  let person = {};

  person.firstName = firstName;
  person.lastName = lastName;

  person.fullName = function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`.trim();
  };

  return person;
}

let john = createPerson('John', 'Doe');
let jane = createPerson('Jane');

john.fullName(); // => 'John Doe'
jane.fullName(); // => 'Jane'
```

We can simplify that somewhat by *returning an object literal*:

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName = '') {
  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,

    fullName: function() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`.trim();
    }
  };
}
```

#### 1.2.3 Factory Function Example 3 - `createRectangle`

```js
function createRectangle(width, length) {
  return {
    width: width, // width,
    length: length, // length,

    getWidth() {
      return this.width;
    },

    getLength() {
      return this.length;
    },

    getArea() {
      return this.width * this.length;
    },
  };
}

let rectangle = createRectangle(4, 5);

console.log(rectangle.getWidth()); // 4
console.log(rectangle.getLength()); // 5
console.log(rectangle.getArea()); // 20
```

### 1.3 Constructors and Prototypes

#### 1.3.1 Object Constructors / Constructors

**Object constructors**, or **constructors** are another way to create objects in JavaScript.  Superficially, a constructor looks and acts a lot like a factory function: you define a constructor once then invoke it each time you want to create an object of that type.

Constructor functions are meant to be invoked with the `new` operator. They instantiate a new object behind the scenes and let the developer manipulate it through the `this` keyword. A typical constructor uses the following pattern:

1. The constructor is invoked with `new`.
2. The JS runtime *creates a new object that inherits from the constructor's prototype object*.
3. The new object is assigned to `this` within the function body.
4. The code in the function body is executed.
5. The function returns the object referenced by `this` unless the function returns an explicit object.

#### 1.3.1.1 The `new` keyword

JavaScript does the following six things when a constructor function is invoked with `new`:

1. Creates a new object.
2. Sets `[[Prototype]] of the new object to the same object as the constructor's `prototype` property.
3. Sets the `constructor` property of the new object to point to the constructor function (the function that created the new object).
4. Sets `this` inside the function to refer to the new object.
5. Invokes the function.
6. Returns the new object implicitly (no `return` expression necessary; explicit return values only override the new object if the return value itself is an object).

```js
// Example where `instanceof` operator confirms if object was made by the constructor function. Using `constructor` property can be more useful.

function Car(make, model) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of methods
}

let truck = new Car("Ford", "F150");
console.log(truck) // => Car { make: 'Ford', model: 'F150', drive: [Function (anonymous)] }
console.log(truck.__proto__ === Car.prototype) // =>  true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(truck) === Car.prototype) // => true
console.log(truck.constructor) // => [Function: Car]
console.log(truck.constructor === Car) // => true
console.log(truck instanceof Car) // => true
```

#### 1.3.2 Prototypes

A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. In JavaScript this is done with the `[[Prototype]]` property ("internal prototype property").

Every function has a `prototype` property that points to an object that contains a `constructor` property. The `constructor` property points back to the function itself. Thus, if `Kumquat` is a constructor function, then `Kumquat.prototype.constructor === Kumquat`.

If the function is used as a constructor, the returned object's `[[Prototype]]` will reference the constructor's `prototype` property. That lets us set properties on the constructor's prototype object so that all objects created by the constructor will share them. We call this the **pseudo-classical** pattern of object creation.

#### 1.3.3. Constructor Function `Car` Example

We don't just want *a* car, however. We want a mechanism that creates any car that has those properties and methods. To do that, we can use a factory function to create individual cars. Another way to accomplish the same thing is to use a constructor function and the `new` keyword:

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.started = false;

  this.start = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  this.stop = function() {
    this.started = false;
  };
}

let corolla = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
let leaf = new Car('Nissan', 'LEAF', 2018);
let nova = new Car('Chevrolet', 'Nova', 1974);
```

Defining a constructor is nearly identical to defining an ordinary function, but there are differences. For starters, notice that *we gave the constructor a name that begins with a capital letter*: `Car`. Capitalizing the name isn't a language requirement, but it is a convention employed by most JavaScript developers.

The function parameters, in general, match the properties associated with each `Car` object. In this case, we supply parameters for all of the properties except `started`, which receives an initial value instead. *The initial value for such properties can come from anywhere.* For instance, we can compute the value from other properties or retrieve a value from a database.

#### 1.3.4 Calling a Constructor Function

The most striking features that distinguish **constructors** from ordinary functions are that:

- we call it with the `new` keyword,
- we use `this` to set the object's properties and methods, and
- we *don't supply an explicit return value* (we can, but usually don't).

By now, we know that `this` always refers to an object. Its value depends on how we call the function. Calling constructors is where you see the most significant difference between them and other functions.

Let's create a `Car` object:

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.started = false;

  this.start = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  this.stop = function() {
    this.started = false;
  };
}

// Using the `new` keyword with the function invocation treats the function as a constructor
let corolla = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);

corolla.make;    // => 'Toyota'
corolla.model;   // => 'Corolla'
corolla.year;    // => 2016
corolla.started; // => false

corolla.start();
corolla.started; // => true
```

Notice that the `new` keyword precedes the function invocation. This combination of using `new` with a function call *treats the function as a constructor*.

JavaScript takes the following steps when you invoke a function with `new`:

1. It creates an entirely new object.
2. It sets the prototype of the new object to the object that is referenced by the constructor's `prototype` property.
3. It sets the value of `this` for use inside the function to point to the new object.
4. It invokes the function. Since `this` refers to the new object, we use it within the function to set the object's properties and methods.
5. Finally, once the function finishes running, `new` returns the new object even though we don't explicitly return anything.

**JavaScript won't complain about a missing `new` keyword.**

```js
Car(); // => undefined
```

If you don't use the `new` keyword, the constructor function won't work as intended. Instead, it *acts like an ordinary function*. In particular, *no new objects are created*, so `this` won't point to a new object.

Furthermore, since functions that don't return an explicit value return `undefined`, calling a constructor without `new` also returns `undefined`. When you use `new`, however, the function doesn't have to return anything explicitly: it *returns the newly created object automatically*.

#### 1.3.5 Lesson 3 Quiz 1 Question 2

In the following code, the `Animal` function is meant to be used as a constructor.

```js
const Animal = function(species) {
  this.species = species;
  return species;
};

Animal.prototype.sleep = function() {
  console.log(`The ${this.species} is sleeping`);
};

let lion = Animal('Panthera leo');
lion.sleep(); // TypeError
```

The constructor should return a new object that can subsequently be used to call the `Animal.prototype.sleep` method shown below. However, this program does not work as intended -- we get a `TypeError` when we try to call `sleep`.

The problem here is that we did not use the `new` operator. Without the `new` operator, `Animal` isn't called as a constructor function. Thus, `this` refers to the global object instead of a new object, and the function returns a string instead of a new object.

#### 1.3.6 Who Can be a Constructor

You can use `new` to call almost any JavaScript function that you create. However, *you cannot call arrow functions with `new`* since they use their surrounding context as the value of `this`:

```js
let Car = (make, model, year) => {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

new Car(); // TypeError: Car is not a constructor
```

You *can also use* `new` on methods that you define in objects. Consider:

```js
let foo = {
  Car: function(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
};

let car1 = new foo.Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2019);
car1.make; //=> 'Toyota'
```

However, *calling a method defined with concise syntax* (also called a concise method) *won't work*:

```js
let foo = {
  Car(make, model, year) { // calling with concise syntax raises an error
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
};

new foo.Car(); //=> Uncaught TypeError: foo.Car is not a constructor
```

In addition, many -- but not all -- **built-in objects and methods** are *incompatible* with `new`:

```js

new console.log(); //=> Uncaught TypeError: console.log is not a constructor
new Math();        //=> Uncaught TypeError: Math is not a constructor
new parseInt("3"); //=> Uncaught TypeError: parseInt is not a constructor

// The `Date` constructor is compatible with `new`
new Date();        //=> 2019-06-26T02:50:20.191Z
```

#### 1.3.6 Constructors with Explicit Return Values

What happens when you use `new` to call a function that returns an explicit value?

```js
function Cat(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;

  return 'a cat';
}

let fluffy = new Cat('fluffy', 'Persian', 15);
console.log(fluffy) // Cat { name: 'fluffy', breed: 'Persian', weight: 15 }
fluffy.weight; // 15
```

That's curious. Even though we explicitly returned the string `'a cat'`, our constructor returned the `Cat` object with `name`, `breed` and `weight` as its properties.

Note that `'a cat'` is a **primitive value**. Suppose we returned an object instead. What would happen, then?

```js
function Cat(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;

  return { foo: 1 };
}

let fluffy = new Cat('fluffy', 'Persian', 15);
console.log(fluffy) // { foo: 1 }
fluffy.weight; // undefined
fluffy.foo; // 1
```

This time the constructor returned the object `{ foo: 1 }`, not a cat object.

The rule here is that *a constructor that explicitly tries to return an object returns that object instead of a new object of the desired type*. In all other situations, it returns the newly created object, provided no errors occur. In particular, *the constructor ignores primitive return values and returns the new object instead*.

#### 1.3.6.1 Lesson 3 Quiz 1 Question 3

Examine the following code:

```js
function Dog() {
}

function Pet(type) {
  if (type === 'dog') {
    return new Dog();
  } else if (type === 'lion') {
    return 'not a pet!';
  }
}

let dog = new Pet('dog');
let lion = new Pet('lion');
let cat = new Pet('cat');
```

Without running the code, determine the type of data that the `dog`, `lion`, and `cat` variables would reference if you were to run it.

- dog: a `Dog` object
- lion: a `Pet` object
- cat: a `Pet` object

A constructor that attempts to *return an object will return an object of that type*. Thus, `dog` refers to a `Dog` object since that's what the constructor tried to return.

A constructor that attempts to *return a non-object value*, such as a string, will instead return a new object of the type associated with the constructor, e.g., `Pet` in this case. Thus, `lion` refers to a `Pet` object *since the constructor attempts to return a string*.

A constructor that *doesn't return an explicit value* will return a new object of the type associated with the constructor, e.g., `Pet`. Thus, `cat` refers to a `Pet` object since the constructor doesn't return an explicit value.

#### 1.3.7 Supplying Constructor Arguments with Plain Objects

Constructor functions sometimes have to grow with the needs of a program. That often means adding more arguments to the constructor. For instance, our `Car` constructor may one day end up looking like this:

```js
function Car(make, model, year, color, passengers, convertible, mileage) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.color = color;
  this.passengers = passengers;
  this.convertible = convertible;
  this.mileage = mileage;
  this.started = false;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of the methods
}
```

That's quite a few parameters, with plenty of opportunities for mistakes. For instance, we may *pass the arguments in the wrong order*, and JavaScript won't complain. The more parameters a function needs, the harder it is to read the code and the more likely that problems will arise.

One common technique that we can use to manage our parameters better involves *passing them to our constructor with an object argument*:

```js
let civicArgs = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Civic',
  year: 2016,
  color: 'black',
  passengers: 5,
  convertible: false,
  mileage: 16000
}

let civic = new Car(civicArgs);
```

Of course, that means that we now have to rework our `Car` constructor to accept an object as an argument:

```js
function Car(args) {
  this.make = args.make;
  this.model = args.model;
  this.year = args.year;
  this.color = args.color;
  this.passengers = args.passengers;
  this.convertible = args.convertible;
  this.mileage = args.mileage;
  this.started = false;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of methods
}
```

With `Object.assign`, we can simplify this constructor considerably:

```js
function Car(args) {
  Object.assign(this, args);

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of methods
}
```

However, one drawback of the `Object.assign` approach is that the `args` object may contain properties that the `Car` object doesn't need. Those additional properties will, nevertheless, get added to the `Car` object. Those properties may just be excess baggage for the objects to carry around, but they *may also cause trouble*.

#### 1.3.8 Determining an Object's Type with the `instanceof` Operator

Many object-oriented languages, like Java or C++, have a strong notion of object types. In most such languages, it's easy to determine the object's type, such as a dog or car. JavaScript, however, treats objects and their types in a looser, more dynamic way. You can't determine the specific type of arbitrary JavaScript objects; they are dynamic structures with a type of `object`, no matter what properties and methods they have. However, *we can get some useful information about an object if we know which constructor created it*.

Remember that the `new` operator creates a new object. Suppose that you call the `Car` constructor with `new`. Informally, we can say that the resulting object is a car. More formally, we can say that the object is an **instance** of a `Car`.

The object that the `new` operator returns *contains some information that ties it back to the constructor that created the object*. The `instanceof` operator uses that information to determine what constructor created the object.

```js
function Car(args) {
  this.make = args.make;
  this.model = args.model;
  this.year = args.year;
  this.color = args.color;
  this.passengers = args.passengers;
  this.convertible = args.convertible;
  this.mileage = args.mileage;
  this.started = false;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of methods
}

let civicArgs = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Civic',
  year: 2016,
  color: 'black',
  passengers: 5,
  convertible: false,
  mileage: 16000
};

let civic = new Car(civicArgs);

if (civic instanceof Car) { // `instanceof` operator
  console.log("It's a car!");
} else {
  console.log("It's not a car.");
}

// => logs 'It's a car!'
```

#### 1.3.9 Constructors with Prototypes

In the previous assignment, we learned how to use constructor functions as factories that create objects. One question we didn't answer, however, was why we need to have constructor functions along with their somewhat strange use of `this` and `new`. We can accomplish practically the same thing with object factories. We'll answer that question in this assignment.

Let's take a closer look at what happens when we create some objects with a constructor (but without a prototype?):

```js
function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;

  this.bark = function() {
    console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
  };
}

let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
let dexter = new Dog('Dexter', 'Rottweiler', 50);
let biggie = new Dog('Biggie', 'Whippet', 9);

maxi.bark(); // 'Woof!'
```

Each of these dog objects, when created, receive the `name`, `breed`, and `weight` properties *as well as the `bark` method*. The properties have values that differ between objects, but the `bark` method remains the same in all. However, every time we create a new dog object, we must create a new `bark` method so we can add it to the object. This is inefficient and wasteful.

We can verify that each object has its own `bark` method with `hasOwnProperty`:

```js
maxi.hasOwnProperty('bark');   // true
dexter.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // true
biggie.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // true
maxi.bark === dexter.bark;     // false
maxi.bark === biggie.bark;     // false
dexter.bark === biggie.bark;   // false
```

#### 1.3.10 Method Delegation to Prototypes

Prototypes are especially useful for sharing methods as *all objects of a particular type share the same prototype objec*t. Delegation means that we can share methods by putting them in the prototype object; *if an object doesn't contain a requested method, JavaScript searches the prototype chain to find the method*. Thus, we can define a method once in the prototype object, and let the inheriting objects delegate the method calls to the prototype. We can use prototypes in conjunction with constructors to achieve this result:

```js
let DogPrototype = {
  bark() {
    console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
  }
};

function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  Object.setPrototypeOf(this, DogPrototype);
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;
  // this.bark method removed.
}
```

In this code, we've changed our `Dog` constructor and created a `DogPrototype` object. The first thing we do inside the constructor is set `DogPrototype` as the prototype of the newly created dog object. We then assign the arguments to the properties.

Note that we can continue to use our constructor without change:

```js
let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
let dexter = new Dog('Dexter', 'Rottweiler', 50);
let biggie = new Dog('Biggie', 'Whippet', 9);

maxi.bark(); // 'Woof!'
```

This time, however, the `bark` method isn't defined on the individual objects, but is, instead, defined on the `[[Prototype]]` property:

```js
maxi.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
dexter.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
biggie.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
Object.getPrototypeOf(maxi).bark === DogPrototype.bark; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(dexter).bark === DogPrototype.bark; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(biggie).bark === DogPrototype.bark; // true
```

The `DogPrototype` object *has the only copy of the method*; all dog objects delegate `bark` to the `DogPrototype` object.

We now have a constructor and a related prototype object. Together, they construct objects of some type. In our code here, we can guess that the constructor and prototype are related by looking at their names. However, it would be better if we could establish that relationship more concretely. Let's assign the prototype object to a property of the `Dog` function.

```js
// Delete DogPrototype

function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  Object.setPrototypeOf(this, Dog.myPrototype);
  // rest of the code
}

// Assign the prototype object to a property of the `Dog` constructor function
Dog.myPrototype = {
  bark() {
    console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
  }
};
```

Since JavaScript functions are objects, we can add properties to them. Here, we assign the prototype object to a `myPrototype` property on the `Dog` function object. Thus, we clearly show our intent that all dogs inherit from the `Dog.myPrototype` object. Once we've done that, we can change our constructor function to use `Dog.myPrototype` as the prototype object.

Here's the complete code as it now stands:

```js
function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  Object.setPrototypeOf(this, Dog.myPrototype);
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;
}

Dog.myPrototype = {
  bark() {
    console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
  }
};

let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
let dexter = new Dog('Dexter', 'Rottweiler', 50);
let biggie = new Dog('Biggie', 'Whippet', 9);

maxi.bark(); // 'Woof!'

maxi.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
dexter.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
biggie.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false

Object.getPrototypeOf(maxi).bark === Dog.myPrototype.bark; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(dexter).bark === Dog.myPrototype.bark; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(biggie).bark === Dog.myPrototype.bark; // true
```

#### 1.3.11 The Constructor `prototype` Property

What makes constructors special is a characteristic of all **function objects** in JavaScript: they all have a prototype property that we call the **function prototype** to distinguish them from the prototypes used when creating ordinary objects. The code we showed in the previous section emulates something that JavaScript bundles with constructors. Let's take a look at that property:

```sh
Dog.prototype; // => Dog {}
```

When you call a function `Foo` with the `new` keyword, JavaScript sets the new object's prototype to the current value of `Foo`'s `prototype` property. That is, the constructor creates an object that inherits from the constructor function's prototype (`Foo.prototype`). Since inheritance in JavaScript uses prototypes, we can also say that *the constructor creates an object whose prototype references `Foo.prototype`.*

The terminology of **constructor prototypes** and **object prototypes** is extremely confusing. Note in particular that we use the term "prototype" to refer to 2 distinct but related concepts:

1. If `bar` is an object, then the object from which `bar` inherits is the **object prototype**. By default, *constructor functions set the object prototype for the objects they create to the constructor's prototype object.*

2. The **constructor's prototype object**, also called the **function prototype**, is an object that the constructor uses as the object prototype for the objects it creates. In other words, each object that the constructor creates inherits from the constructor's prototype object. The constructor stores its prototype object in its `prototype` property; that is, if the constructor's name is `Foo`, then `Foo.prototype` references the constructor's prototype object.

In most cases, when we talk about a **prototype** without being more explicit, we mean an **object prototype**. We'll talk about the **constructor's prototype**, the **function prototype**, or the **`prototype` property** when talking about a constructor's prototype object.

- Prototype => object prototype

- Constructor Prototype => Function Prototype or `prototype` property

Note that *constructors don't inherit from the constructor's prototype object*. Instead, *the objects that the constructor creates inherit from it*.

*Every JavaScript function has a `prototype` property*. However, JavaScript only uses it when you call that function as a constructor by using the `new` keyword.

With this information, we can abandon our home-grown constructor-prototype pairing and use the one that JavaScript provides instead:

```js
// JavaScript's provided constructor-prototype pairing
function Dog (name, breed, weight) {
  // deleted Object.setPrototypeOf(this, Dog.myPrototype);
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;
}

Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
};

let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
maxi.bark(); // 'Woof!'

let biggie = new Dog('Biggie', 'Whippet', 9);
biggie.bark(); // 'Yip!'
```

Here's a diagram illustrating the `prototype` and `constructor` links we've discussed.

![constructor-prototype-map](constructor-prototype-map.png)

Note that our constructor doesn't have to explicitly set the prototype of `this` to `Dog.prototype`. JavaScript does that for us when we call the function with `new`. We left this detail out earlier, so let's restate those steps with updated information. We'll assume that the constructor function is named `Foo`:

1. It creates an entirely new object.
2. It sets `Foo.prototype` as the prototype for the new object. That is, the new object inherits from the object referenced by `Foo.prototype`.
3. It sets the execution context (`this`) for the function to point to the new object.
4. It invokes the function.
5. It returns the new object *unless the function returns another object*.

Since the `bark` method refers to `this` and `bark` belongs to the prototype object, you may think that `this` in `this.weight` refers to the prototype object rather than the object itself (e.g., `maxi` or `biggie`). However, that's not how `this` binding works.

When you call a method on an object, JavaScript binds `this` to the object whose method you used to call it. If it doesn't find the method in that object, but it does find it in the prototype, that doesn't change the value of `this`. `this` always refers to the original object -- that is, the object used to call the method -- even if the method is in the prototype. If we find the `bark` method in the prototype, `this` references the original dog object, not the prototype.

A property of interest on a prototype object is the `constructor` property. For instance:

```sh
Dog.prototype.constructor; // [Function: Dog]
```

As with the `instanceof` operator, the `constructor` property lets us determine the type of an object:

```js
let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);

if (maxi.constructor === Dog) {
  console.log("It's a dog");
} else {
  console.log("It's not a dog");
}

// => 'It's a dog'
```

Be careful, however. *It's possible to reassign the `constructor` property to something else*. In that case, the test shown above would fail, even though the object is still a dog.

```js
Dog.prototype.constructor = function() {};

maxi.constructor === Dog; // false
maxi instanceof Dog;      // true
```

Note that `instanceOf` still works.

#### 1.3.12 Overriding the Prototype

Inheriting methods from a prototype doesn't mean that the inheriting object is stuck with those methods. *JavaScript objects are incredibly dynamic and flexible*. Two objects created with the same constructor may end up looking completely different from each other because of changes and additions made after constructing the object. For instance, suppose we have a `dexter` dog that has an unusually loud and deep bark. We want to change the `bark` method to log `WOOF!` instead of `Woof!`. We can do that easily by *defining a custom* `bark` method on `dexter`.

```js
let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
let dexter = new Dog('Dexter', 'Rottweiler', 50);

dexter.bark = function() {
  console.log('WOOF!');
}

maxi.bar(); // Woof!
dexter.bark(); // WOOF!
```

The `dexter` object now has its own `bark` method that **overrides** the `bark` method from `Dog.prototype`. Each time we call `bark` on `dexter`, *JavaScript looks for it first in the `dexter` object itself*. Since it finds it there, it doesn't need to check the prototype.

##### 1.3.12.1 Another Constructor and Prototype Example

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getWidth = function() {
  return this.width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getLength = function() {
  return this.length;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.width * this.length;
}

let rectangle1 = new Rectangle(5, 4);
console.log(rectangle1.getWidth()); // 4
console.log(rectangle1.getLength()); // 5
console.log(rectangle1.getArea()); // 20
```

##### 1.3.12.2 And Another Constructor/Prototype Pattern

```js
function Book(author, title, isbn) {
  this.author = author;
  this.title = title;
  this.isbn = isbn;
}

Book.prototype.describe = function() {
  console.log(this.title + ' was written by ' + this.author + '.');
};

let book = new Book("Neal Stephenson", "Snow Crash", "0-553-08853-X");
```

##### 1.3.12.2 And Another Constructor and Prototype Example

The reason we get the following output is because the `new` operator sets the context to the new object that's created. Because of this, technically a, b, c etc. don't exist as properties on the constructor, they exist as properties in the instantiated object.

```js
function MyClass(a, b, c, d, e, f) {
  this.a = a;
  this.b = b;
  this.c = c;
  this.d = d;
  this.e = e;
  this.f = f;
}

let func = new MyClass(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(func)); // [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' ]
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(MyClass)); // [ 'length', 'name', 'arguments', 'caller', 'prototype' ]
```

#### 1.3.13 Subtyping with Constructors and Prototypes

The combination of constructors and prototypes gives us something that resembles a **class**, a construct used in classical OOP languages like Java, Python, and Ruby. A *class is a blueprint for creating objects*. Traditional OOP languages use classes to create distinct objects of a particular type and give those objects the behaviors and state that they need.

*Constructors and prototypes let us mimic classes in JavaScript*. Until recently, the language had nothing that you could reasonably call a class. That made it hard for developers familiar with class-based languages to switch to JavaScript. One can even argue that constructors and prototypes are part of the language solely to make it easier for developers to switch to JavaScript.

An essential part of the OO paradigm is the concept of inheritance. In most OOP languages, inheritance means something a bit different from the way we use it in conjunction with JavaScript. That can make JavaScript inheritance confusing if you've seen inheritance in other languages. For now, it may be wise to forget what you think you know about inheritance based on those other languages.

Let's look at an example that shows why we might need inheritance in an application. Assume that we have a drawing application that lets the user work with shapes. In this app, the constructor/prototype combination for rectangles might look like this:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length;
  this.width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

Rectangle.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Rectangle ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}
```

We can create and manipulate `Rectangle` objects like so:

```js
let rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
rect.getArea(); // => 50
rect.toString(); // '[Rectangle 10 x 5]'
```

Our `Rectangle` constructor creates rectangle objects that have `width` and `length` as properties and the methods `getArea` and `toString`.

Suppose our application also needs squares. We can set up another constructor/prototype combination for those squares, and then follow the same pattern we used for rectangles:

```js
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

Square.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
};

let sqr = new Square(5);
sqr.getArea();     // => 25
sqr.toString();    // => "[Square 5 x 5]"
```

There's some code duplication between this code and the `Rectangle` code. In particular, `Square.prototype.getArea` and `Rectangle.prototype.getArea` are **identical**. That gives us a chance to *reuse some code*.

We can *use prototypal inheritance to our advantage here*. One way to think about the relationship between `Square` and `Rectangle` is that a square is a special kind of rectangle where both the length and width are the same. We say that `Square` is a **subtype** of `Rectangle`, or that `Rectangle` is a **supertype** of `Square`. Consider the following code:

```js
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);

Square.prototype.toString() = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
};

let sqr = new Square(5);
sqr.getArea(); // => 25
sqr.toString(); // "[Square 5 x 5]"
```

Since a function's `prototype` property is writable -- we can change what object it references -- we can reassign `Square.prototype` to an object that inherits from `Rectangle.prototype`. The result is a **prototype chain** that looks like this:

```js
sqr ---> Square.prototype ---> Rectangle.prototype ---> Object.prototype
```

All objects created by the `Square` constructor inherit from `Square.prototype`, which we have set up to inherit from `Rectangle.prototype`. Thus, all square objects have access to methods on `Rectangle.prototype`. Since `toString` must be different for squares, we *override* it in `Square.prototype`. That is, we customize `Square.prototype.toString`. Since `getArea` *requires no customization*, we can let square objects use the inherited `Rectangle.prototype.getArea`.

#### 1.3.14 Restoring the `constructor` property

One side-effect of this approach is that the `constructor` property on square objects points to `Rectangle` when it should point to `Square` instead:

```js
// omitted code

sqr.constructor === Rectangle; // => true
```

Why does that happen? It happens since we reassign `Square.prototype` to a new object that inherits from `Rectangle.prototype`, and the `constructor` property for `Rectangle.prototype` points back to `Rectangle`. Thus, `Square.prototype.constructor` points to `Rectangle`. To fix this situation, we merely need to reassign `Square.prototype.constructor` to `Square`:

```js
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);
Square.prototype.constructor = Square; // <-- reassign

Square.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}

let sqr = new Square(5);
sqr.getArea(); // => 25
sqr.toString(); // => '[Square 5 x 5]'
sqr.constructor = Square; // => true
```

Why do we need to reassign the constructor property? In most cases, failure to reassign it won't hurt anything, and it certainly doesn't in this code. However, there are [situations where the value of the `constructor` property is important](https://2ality.com/2011/06/constructor-property.html).

#### 1.3.15 Constructor Reuse

If you examine the bodies of the `Rectangle` and `Square` functions, you'll see that they're similar. That suggests that we may be able to use the `Rectangle` constructor in `Square`. To do that, we must *invoke `Rectangle` with its execution context explicitly set to the execution context of `Square`*:

```js
function Square(size) {
  Rectangle.call(this, size, size);
}
```

Our code now looks like this:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.area;
}

Rectangle.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Rectangle ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}

// rect test code omitted

function Square(size) {
  Rectangle.call(this, size, size);
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);
Square.prototype.constructor = Square;

Square.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}

// sqr test code omittted
```

The combination of constructors and prototypes provides a way of mimicking classical inheritance with JavaScript. This lets us create **subtype** objects, which can 'inherit' methods from a **supertype** object. This is one way of facilitating code re-use.

### 1.4 OLOO (Objects Linking to Other Objects)

The **Objects Linking to Other Objects (OLOO)** pattern of object creation uses a prototype object, an initializer method, and the `Object.create()` method to create objects with shared behavior (e.g., car objects). The initializer customizes the state for each object, and is usually named `init`. All objects of the same type inherit from the prototype. *Thus OLOO uses prototypal inheritance.*

What properties are common to all car objects? Here, those properties are the `start` and `stop` methods. All cars have `make`, `model`, `year`, and `started` properties as well, but each object has different values for those properties. Thus, we don't count them as being common to all cars.

We can extract the `start` and `stop` methods to a prototype object.

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },
};
```

Now that we have a car prototype object, all car objects can inherit from it:

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.make = 'Toyota';
car1.model = 'Corolla';
car1.year = 2016;
```

We can now call `start` and `stop` on the `car1` object since both are accessible through its prototype, `carPrototype`.

```js
car1.start();
car1.started; // => true

car1.stop();
car1.started; // => false
```

Calling `start` and `stop` on the `car1` object changes the state of `car1` even though those methods don't belong to `car1`. That shouldn't come as a surprise since we're using `car1` as the execution context for the calls. When we call these methods, `this` is set to `car1`, so the methods change the `started` property in `car1`.

We've set up a car prototype that all our car objects can inherit. However, we still have a small problem: *we must set the `make`, `model`, and `year` properties manually every time we create a car object*. Can we automate that? Fortunately, yes; there's more than one way. The most common technique uses an `init` method on the prototype object:

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },

  init(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  },
};
```

We can then use it like so:

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.init('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
```

This code is certainly better, but we still need two lines of code to create a new car object. A small improvement to our `init` method can change that as well:

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },

  init(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    return this; // <-- small improvement to the `init` method
  },
};
```

Since `init` now returns a reference to the car object it was called on, we can chain `create` and `init` and assign the result to the `car1` variable.

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype).init('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
```

#### 1.4.1 Examples of the OLOO Object Creation Pattern

```js
// OLOO (uses `init` and an explicit return in the constructor)
let rectanglePrototype = {
  init(length, width) {
    this.width = width;
    this.length = length;
    return this;
  },

  getWidth() {
    return this.width;
  },

  getLength() {
    return this.length;
  },

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.length;
  },
};

let olooRectangle = Object.create(rectanglePrototype).init(5, 4);

console.log(olooRectangle.getWidth()); // 4
console.log(olooRectangle.getLength()); // 5
console.log(olooRectangle.getArea()); // 20
```

```js
let Book = {
  init(author, title, ISBN) {
    this.author = author;
    this.title = title;
    this.ISBN = ISBN;
    return this;
  }

  describe() {
    console.log(this.title + ' was written by ' + this.author + '.');
  },
}

let book = Object.create(Book).init("Jame Baldwin", "Another Country", "0-679-74471-1 (pbk.)");
```

```js
let Cat = {
  init(name, gender) {
    this.name = name;
    this.gender = gender;
    return this;
  },

  log() {
    console.log(`Meow! My name is ${this.name}. I'm a ${this.gender} cat.`);
  },
}

let kitty = Object.create(Cat).init("Pudding", "girl");
kitty.log(); // => Meow! My name is Pudding. I'm a girl cat.
```

#### 1.4.2 Advantage of OLOO over Factory Functions

You can use both factory functions and the OLOO pattern to bulk create objects of the same type. Though the result is an object creation mechanism in both cases, the OLOO pattern has one significant advantage over factory functions: **memory efficiency**. Since all objects created with the OLOO pattern *inherit methods from a single prototype object*, the objects that inherit from that prototype object share the same methods. Factory functions, on the other hand, create copies of all the methods for each new object. That can have a significant performance impact, especially on smaller devices with limited memory.

However, that doesn't mean that OLOO is decidedly better than the factory pattern. An advantage of the factory pattern is that it lets us *create objects with private state*. If that doesn't make sense to you yet, don't worry. We'll return to this topic in a later course when we discuss **closures**.

### 1.5 ES6 Classes

#### 1.5.1 [Classes Introduction](https://launchschool.com/gists/6ba85481)

The ECMAScript 6 (ES6) standard added the `class` keyword to JavaScript. In effect, classes act like **syntactic sugar** -- syntax designed to be easier to read or use -- that makes it easier for programmers to migrate to JavaScript from other OOP languages. *The `class` statement gets translated behind the scenes to a constructor function and a prototype object, and the class name refers to the constructor function.* In essence, they provide little more than a more natural and possibly familiar way to create constructors and prototypes.

The syntax for defining classes is similar to that of defining functions. In particular, both functions and classes have two significant definition styles: declarations and expressions.

ES6 classes provide a cleaner, more compact alternative to constructors and prototypes. As with functions, they are first-class citizens and come in the form of declarations and expressions. Functionally, classes behave almost identically to the constructors and prototypes they aim to replace. Classes allow for static methods by using the `static` modifier.

A class is a kind of template for creating concrete objects of that type. Each concrete object is called an instance of the class. The process of creating an instance is performed by a special function called a **constructor**. We pass the constructor values for any internal state that we want to initialize in the new instance.

#### 1.5.2 A Simple Type - Constructor and Prototype Pattern

Before we get into the `class` syntax, let's first define a simple `Rectangle` type using the familiar **constructor** and **prototype** pattern:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

let rec = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(typeof Rectangle); // function
console.log(rec instanceof Rectangle); // true
console.log(rec.constructor); // [Function: Rectangle]
console.log(rec.getArea()); // 50
```

The object created by the `Rectangle` constructor, `rec`, is an **instance** of the `Rectangle` type, and we can call the `getArea` method from its prototype to calculate the area.

If you call the `Rectangle` constructor without the `new` keyword, the constructor won't work properly.

#### 1.5.3 Class Declarations

**Class declarations** begin with the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class. The rest of the syntax looks similar to the simplified (concise) method definition that you can use in object literals. However, there are *no commas between the properties of the class*.

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(length, width) { // `constructor` is a method named constructor inside the class
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  } // no commas between the properties of the class

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.width;
  }
}

let rec = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(typeof Rectangle); // function
console.log(rec instanceof Rectangle); // true
console.log(rec.constructor); // [class Rectangle]
console.log(rec.getArea()); // 50
```

One significant difference is that the `constructor` is now a method named constructor inside our class instead of being a standalone function. Other methods have no special meaning; you can define as many as you need. In this case, we define `getArea`, and it gets placed in `Rectangle.prototype`.

In most situations, instantiating a new object from a class is identical to creating one with the constructor/prototype pattern:

```js
let rec = new Rectangle(10, 5);
```

You can even call methods on `Rectangle.prototype` in the same way:

```js
console.log(rec.getArea());
```

The class code and instantiation is so similar to the constructor/prototype code that `typeof` even returns `'function'`, and the object checks out as an instance of `Rectangle`:

```js
console.log(typeof Rectangle); // "function"
console.log(rec instanceof Rectangle); // true
```

One minor difference is that `rec.constructor` may produce different results in the two patterns. For example, in Node, logging `rec.constructor` produces `[Function: Rectangle]` for the constructor/prototype example, and `[class Rectangle]` for the class example. This difference is implementation dependent, and not considered significant.

There is one significant difference, however: you ***must*** use the `new` keyword to call the constructor when using a `class`. JavaScript raises a `TypeError` if you try to call the constructor without the `new` keyword.

Using classes, *it's possible to do everything you can with the constructor and prototype pattern*. However, the class syntax is easier to read and write, and the enforced `new` keyword helps prevent bugs.

#### 1.5.4 Class Expressions

Functions have an *expression* form that does not require a name after the function keyword. Classes have a similar expression form. Consider the following code:

```js
let Rectangle = class { // class expression
  constructor(length, width) {
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.width;
  }
};
```

Aside from the syntax, class expressions are functionally equivalent to class declarations. Which you use is primarily a matter of style.

#### 1.5.4.1 Examples of Class Expression Syntax

```js
// 1
let Cat = class {
  // omitted code
}

// 2
console.log(
  class Cat {
    // omitted code
  }
);

// 3
function createClass() {
  return (
    class Cat {
      // omitted code
    }
  );
};
```

#### 1.5.5 Classes as First-Class Citizens

In programming, a **first-class citizen** is a value that can be passed into a function, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable. Like JavaScript functions, JavaScript classes are also first-class values. For example, you can *pass classes into functions as arguments*:

```js
function createObject(classDef) {
  return new classDef();
}

class Foo {
  sayHi() {
    console.log('Hi');
  }
}

let obj = createObject(Foo);
obj.sayHi(); // => logs 'Hi!'
```

Classes are just functions, as demonstrated with `typeof`:

```js
typeof Foo; // => "function"
```

Since functions are first-class objects, classes must also be first-class objects!

#### 1.5.6 Static Methods and Properties

You may remember seeing some methods like `Array.isArray` and `Object.keys` that are invoked with Array or Object as the caller instead of an actual array or object. For instance:

```js
Array.isArray([1, 2, 3]); // => true
[1, 2, 3].isArray();      // raises a TypeError
```

**Static Methods** like these are *defined on the constructor for the type*, e.g., `Array` or `Object`.

Ordinary methods -- those defined on a prototype object -- are sometimes called **instance methods** or **object methods** since you need an instance of (an object) the type. More commonly, they are simply called methods.

*You can define static methods on your custom constructor methods*. For instance, let's add one to the `Rectangle` type we defined earlier:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.getDescription = function() {
  return 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
}

console.log(Rectangle.getDescription()); // A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides
```

This code defines a **static method** named `getDescription` on the `Rectangle` constructor. To use this method, you invoke it with the `Rectangle` function object.

It should come as no surprise that you can define static methods with the `class` keyword as well: just *use the static keyword*:

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(length, width) {
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  }

  static getDescription() {
    return 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.width;
  }
}

console.log(Rectangle.getDescription()); // A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides
```

As before, we call the method with the name of the constructor function -- in the case of a class, the constructor function's name is the name of the class.

You can also define static properties. Static properties are properties that are defined on the constructor function instead of the individual objects. *One well-known example of a static property is the `length` property used by the `String` type*. To define a static property with the constructor and prototype pattern, just add it to the constructor function object:

```js
Rectangle.description = 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
```

To do the same thing with a `class`, just use the `static` keyword inside the `class`:

```js
class Rectangle {
  static description = 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
}
```

As of this writing in late 2020, static properties are a recent addition to JavaScript. They aren't completely supported, yet. Fortunately, recent versions of Node support them, which means we can use them in our code in this course. If you want to use static properties in a browser or an older version of Node that doesn't support them, you can accomplish the same effect by adding a property directly to the class:

```js
Rectangle.description = 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
```

Yes, that code is identical to what we would write if we were using the constructor/prototype pattern.

#### 1.5.7 Another Example - ES6 Class (Pseudo-classical inheritance)

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, length) {
    this.width = width;
    this.length = length;
  }

  getWidth() {
    return this.width;
  }

  getLength() {
    return this.length;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.length;
  }
}

let rect = new Rectangle(4, 5);

console.log(rect.getWidth()); // 4
console.log(rect.getLength()); // 5
console.log(rect.getArea()); // 20
```

In the constructor function we are creating two properties `width` and `length` and assigning to them values of parameters with the same name. To access the value of each property within methods, we use the `this` keyword in front of each property name.

## 2. Methods and Properties; Instance and Static Methods and Properties

In OOP, we often refer to individual objects of a specific data type as **instances** of that type. In the previous `Dog` example , `maxi` and `dexter` are instances of the `Dog` type. An instance is just another term for the objects created using any means of defining multiple objects of the same kind (e.g., dogs). The term **object** is more general, while **instance** is more specific.

So far, we've been using constructors to create instances of the `Dog` type. We can also think of objects created by factory functions as instances. Later, we'll see even more ways to create new objects, all of which can be called instances.

Hold on there. Factory functions can create instances? How can that be? There's no way to tell that the objects created by, say, a `createDog` factory are indeed dogs, so how can we have instances?

That's a good point. However, in the end, we know that the `createDog` factory is going to create a bunch of objects that we know to represent dogs. We may not be able to tell whether an arbitrary object is a dog object, but all of the objects created by `createDog` should be dogs. They have a type -- dog -- even if there is no way to test that in your code. Thus, they are instances of a dog type.

### 2.1 Instance Properties

It's convenient to describe the properties of an instance as **instance properties**. These properties belong to a specific instance of some type. Thus, in our `Dog` example from the earlier assignment, we say that the `name`, `breed`, and `weight` properties are all instance properties of the various instances of the `Dog` type. If we want to access the weight for `Maxi` from the above example, we must use the `maxi` object:

```js
maxi.weight; // 32
```

If we try to use the constructor, instead, it won't work:

```js
Dog.weight; // undefined
```

This code returns `undefined` since `weight` isn't a property of the constructor; it's a property of the instances created by that constructor. It also doesn't make sense to define it on the constructor function: weight is a property of an individual dog, not one that is related to dogs as a type.

### 2.2 Instance Methods

Since methods are also properties on an object, we can refer to methods stored directly in an object as instance properties too. More commonly, we call them **instance methods** just to distinguish them from ordinary data properties.

However, methods usually aren't stored directly in instances. Instead, they are *usually defined in the object's prototype object*. While methods defined in the prototype object aren't stored in the instance object, they still operate on individual instances. Therefore, we usually refer to them as instance methods. Instance methods are stored either as part of an object or somewhere in the object's prototype chain. *In our `Dog` example, `bark` is an instance method since it's defined on the `Dog.prototype` object.*

As with `weight`, we must use an object created by the `Dog` constructor to invoke `bark`:

```js
maxi.bark(); // Woof!
```

Again, we can't use the constructor to call this method:

```js
Dog.bark(); // TypeError: Dog.bark is not a function
```

In this specific example, we can call `Dog.prototype.bark()`, but that doesn't always work well. For instance, calling `Dog.prototype.bark()` won't recognize the fact that `dexter` has a different version of `bark`.

Any method defined in any prototype in the prototype chain of an object is considered to be an instance method of the object.

### 2.3 Object Instance Methods

#### 2.3.1 `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototype)`

- sets the prototype (i.e., the internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of a specified object to another object or `null`
- **Parameters**
  - `obj` - The object which is to have its prototype set.
  - `prototype` - The object's new prototype (an object or `null`).

#### 2.3.2 `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty(prop)`

- returns a boolean indicating whether the instance object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it). Returns `true` if the object has the specified property as own property; `false` otherwise.
- **Parameters**
  - `prop`  - the String name or Symbol of the property to test

### 2.4 Static Properties

Static properties are defined and accessed *directly on the constructor*, not on an instance or a prototype. Typically, static properties belong to the type (e.g., `Dog`) rather than to the individual instances or the prototype object.

For instance, dogs belong to the species "Canis lupus". That property of dogs doesn't have anything to do with individual dogs; it's information that is pertinent about all dogs. Therefore, it makes sense to add this property directly to the `Dog` constructor as a static property:

```js
Dog.species = "Canis lupus";
```

Now, when our application needs to know the species that dogs belong to, we can *access it from the constructor directly*:

```js
console.log(`Dogs belong to the species ${Dog.species}`);
```

One common use of static properties is to keep track of all of the objects created by a constructor. For instance:

```js
function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;
  Dog.allDogs.push(this); // static property
}

Dog.allDogs = [];
```

In this case, the static property `allDogs` contains an array with a reference to every dog object created while the program is running. While `allDogs` maintains a list of all the dogs, it isn't information that is pertinent to a specific dog -- it's information about dogs in general. Therefore, it should be a static property.

### 2.5 Static Methods

Static methods are methods that *apply to the constructor or class itself*, not a specific object created by that constructor or class. Static properties don't have to be ordinary data properties. You can also define static methods:

```js
// Example 1
Dog.showSpecies = function() {
  console.log(`Dogs belong to the species ${Dog.species}`);
};

Dog.showSpecies();
```

```js
// Constructor Static and Instance Methods Example
function Constructor() {}

Constructor.staticMethod = function() {};

Constructor.prototype.instanceMethod = {
  function() {}
}
```

```js
// Class Static and Instance Methods Example
class Class {
  constructor() {}

  static staticMethod() {}

  instanceMethod() {}
}
```

You've already seen examples of static methods on **built-in JavaScript constructors**.`Object.assign`, `Array.isArray`, and `Date.now` are all examples of static methods.

### 2.6 Object Static Methods

#### 2.6.1 `Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])` - Inheritance

- returns a **new object**, using an *existing object* as the **prototype** of the newly created object.
- **Parameters**
  - `proto` - the object which is the prototype of the newly-created object (i.e. the newly created object will inherit from this)
  - `[propertiesObject]` - If specified and not `undefined`, an object whose enumerable **own** properties (that is, those properties defined upon itself and *not* enumerable properties along its prototype chain) specify property descriptors to be added to the newly-created object, with the corresponding property names. These properties correspond to the second argument of `Object.defineProperties()`
- **Exceptions**
  - `proto` - must be either an Object (excluding primitive wrapper objects), or `null` - otherwise a `TypeError` is thrown

#### 2.6.2 `Object.assign(target, ...sources)` - Mixins

- method **copies** all enumerable own properties from one or more `source` objects to a `target` object. It returns the modified target object. Properties in the target object are overwritten by properties in the sources if they have the same key. Later sources' properties overwrite earlier ones.
- The `Object.assign()` method only copies ***enumerable* and *own*** properties from a source object to a target object. It uses `[[Get]]` on the source and `[[Set]]` on the target, so it will invoke getters/setters, and therefore it ***assigns*** properties.
- **Parameters**
  - `target` the target object — what to apply the sources’ properties to, which is returned after it is modified.
  - `sources` the source object(s) — objects containing the properties you want to apply.

#### 2.6.3 `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`

- returns the object prototype (i.e. the value of the internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of the specified object.
- **Returns -** the prototype of the given object. If there are no inherited properties, `null` is returned.

#### 2.6.4 `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)`

- **Description -** method returns an **array** of all properties (**including non-enumerable properties**) found **directly in a given object.**
- Code Example - Useful if you want to show all the methods available to a certain Data Type

```js
// Display All of the Properties (including non-enumerable properties) in an Object
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Array.prototype));
/* returns
[
  'length',      'constructor',    'concat',
  'copyWithin',  'fill',           'find',
  'findIndex',   'lastIndexOf',    'pop',
  'push',        'reverse',        'shift',
  'unshift',     'slice',          'sort',
  'splice',      'includes',       'indexOf',
  'join',        'keys',           'entries',
  'values',      'forEach',        'filter',
  'flat',        'flatMap',        'map',
  'every',       'some',           'reduce',
  'reduceRight', 'toLocaleString', 'toString',
  'at'
]
*/
```

### 2.7.`instanceof` Operator

- tests to see if the `prototype` property of a **constructor** appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. The return value is a boolean value. The left-hand side should be an `object`, and the right-hand side should be `constructor function`
- **Syntax -** object instanceof constructor
- **Parameters**
  - **`object` -** The object to test.
  - **`constructor` -** Function to test against

The `instanceof` operator requires the object to the right to have a `prototype` property, such as a function object. In most cases, that means the object on the right is a constructor function or class.

## 3. Prototypal and Pseudo-classical Inheritance

JavaScript objects can *inherit properties from other objects*. The object that another object inherits properties from is its **prototype**. In most cases, we use `Object.create` to create objects whose prototype we need to *set explicitly*. We can also use `Object.setPrototypeOf` to *set the prototype of an object that already exists*.

The prototype chain, or prototypal inheritance, is how JavaScript inherits properties from other objects.

By default, *all object literals inherit from* `Object.prototype`.

When you access a property on an object, JavaScript looks for the property first in the object, then its prototype chain, all the way up to `Object.prototype`.

Every object has an internal `[[Prototype]]` property that points to a special object, the object's prototype. It is used to look up properties that don't exist on the object itself.

- `Object.create` returns a new object with the passed-in argument as its prototype.
- You can use `Object.getPrototypeOf` and `obj.isPrototypeOf` to check for prototype relationships between objects.

Looking up a property in the prototype chain is the basis for prototypal inheritance, or property sharing through the prototype chain. Objects lower down in the chain inherit properties and behaviors from objects in the chain above. That is, downstream objects can delegate properties or behaviors to upstream objects.

- A downstream object *overrides* an inherited property if it has a property with the same name. (Overriding is similar to shadowing, but it doesn't completely hide the overridden properties.)
- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` and `obj.hasOwnProperty` can be used to *test whether an object owns a given property*.

The pseudo-classical inheritance pattern has types (e.g., classes) that inherit from other types. This way, all objects of a given type can share behaviors from the same source.

It's all prototypal inheritance happening in the background, but you can leverage the constructor/prototype pattern to kind of mimic how traditional OOP languages deal with inheritance. So pseudo-classical means literally that, mimicking classical inheritance.

### 3.1 Prototypes

In JavaScript, objects can *inherit properties and behavior from other objects*. If another object, for instance, has a `language` property and a `speak` behavior, a new object can access and use `language` and `speak` without explicitly defining them in the new object.

More specifically, JavaScript objects use something called **prototypal inheritance**. The object that you inherit properties and methods from is called the **prototype**. The function `Object.create` creates a new object that inherits properties from an existing object. It takes an object that is called the prototype object as an argument, and returns a new object that inherits properties from the prototype object. The newly created object has access to all the properties and methods that the prototype object provides.

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
};

let b = Object.create(a);
b.foo; // => 1
```

An unusual aspect of this relationship is that the **inheriting object** (`b` above) doesn't receive any properties or methods of its own. Instead, it **delegates** property and method access to its prototype. You can see this in the node console:

```sh
> let a = { foo: 1, bar: 2 }
undefined

> let b = Object.create(a)
undefined

> b.foo
1

> b
{}
```

Evaluating `b` in the node console *gives us an empty object*, which demonstrates that `b` *doesn't have any properties of its own*. We can also use the `hasOwnProperty` method to demonstrate this:

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
};

let b = Object.create(a);

console.log(a.hasOwnProperty('foo')); // => true
console.log(b.hasOwnProperty('foo')); // => false
```

The `hasOwnProperty` method is available on all JavaScript objects. It takes the name of a property as a string and returns `true` if the object has a property by that name, `false` if it does not.

JavaScript objects use an internal `[[Prototype]]` property to keep track of their prototype. When you create an object with `Object.create()`, *the new object's `[[Prototype]]` property gets assigned to the prototype object*.

Note that `[[Prototype]]` is an **internal** property: you cannot access it directly in your code. However, you can access and replace its value with `Object` functions. For instance, `Object.getPrototypeOf()` takes an object as an argument and returns its prototype object:

```js
> Object.getPrototypeOf(b)
{ foo: 1, bar: 2}
```

You can use `Object.setPrototypeOf()` to set the prototype object of an object:

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
},

let b = {}; // line 6
Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a); // line 7

console.log(b.foo); // => 1
console.log(b); // => {}
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(b)); // { foo: 1, bar: 2}
```

The code on lines 6 and 7 is effectively identical to the code that we used on line 6 of the `Object.create` example. However, in this example, we declare and initialize `b` to an empty object rather than using `Object.create`; we then use `Object.setPrototypeOf` to set the prototype object.

An important consideration when dealing with prototypes is that *objects hold a reference* to their prototype objects through their internal `[[Prototype]]` property. If the object's prototype changes in some way, the changes are *observable in the inheriting object as well*.

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
};

let b = {};
Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a);
console.log(b.foo) // => 1

a.foo = 42;
console.log(b.foo); // => 42

// adds key 'baz' with value 12
a.baz = 12;
console.log(b.baz); // => 12
```

### 3.2 The Default Prototype

As mentioned above, all JavaScript objects have access to the `hasOwnProperty()` method. Where does JavaScript get that method? When we create a new object, we don't have to add our own `hasOwnProperty()` method. Instead, JavaScript obtains the method from the object's prototype. *All JavaScript objects inherit from a prototype*. For instance:

```sh
> let a = {}
undefined

> Object.getPrototypeOf(a)
{}
```

Passing an empty object to `Object.getPrototypeOf()` *returns a default prototype object*. That object is the **prototype** for all objects created by using the object literal syntax (e.g., `{ a: 2 }`). The default prototype is the prototype object of the `Object` constructor, `Object.prototype`. `Object.prototype` provides the default prototype.

### 3.3 Iterating Over Objects with Prototypes

- A `for/in` loop iterates over an object's properties. The iteration *includes properties from the objects in its prototype chain*. Use `hasOwnProperty()` *to skip the prototype properties*.

- `Object.keys()` returns an object's "own" property keys -- you do not need to use `hasOwnProperty()`.

Note that both `for/in` and `Object.keys()` deal with **enumerable properties**, which is merely a way of talking about properties you can iterate over. Not all properties are enumerable. In particular, most properties and methods of the *built-in types are not*. Usually, any properties or methods you define for an object are enumerable. You can check whether a property is enumerable with the `Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable()` method. You do not have to remember how to use `propertyIsEnumerable`.

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr.propertyIsEnumerable('length'));                     // false
console.log(arr.propertyIsEnumerable('2'));                          // true
console.log(arr.propertyIsEnumerable('forEach'));                    // false
console.log(Array.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable('forEach'));        // false

function Foo() {
  this.bar = "qux"
}

Foo.prototype.baz = function() {};
let foo = new Foo();
console.log(foo.propertyIsEnumerable('bar'));                        // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(foo).propertyIsEnumerable('baz')); // true
```

### 3.4 The Prototype Chain

Earlier, we said that all JavaScript objects could inherit from another object using the prototype model. Since the prototype of an object is itself an object, the prototype can also have a prototype from which it inherits. For example:

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
};

let b = {
  bar: 2,
};

let c = {
  baz: 3,
};

Object.setPrototypeOf(c, b);
Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a);

console.log(c.bar); // => 2
console.log(c.foo); // => 1
```

In this code, object `c` inherits from object `b` which, in turn, inherits from `a`. Stated differently, `b` is the prototype of `c` and `a` is the prototype of `b`. All properties that you can access on `a` or `b` are now available on `c`. We say that objects `b` and `a` are part of the **prototype chain** of object `c`. The complete prototype chain also *includes the default prototype*, which is the prototype of object `a` in this case. Since the prototype of `Object.prototype` is `null`, the complete prototype chain looks like this:

```sh
c --> b --> a --> Object.prototype --> null
```

### 3.5 The `__proto__` Property

Many older JavaScript programs use a property named `__proto__`, which is pronounced **dunder proto**, instead of `Object.setPrototypeOf` and `Object.getPrototypeOf`. "dunder" is a shortened version of "double underscore", which alludes to the double underscores at the beginning and end of the name. The `__proto__` property is a *deprecated*, non-hidden version of the `[[Prototype]]` property. As a rule, you should only use `__proto__` if you need to support very old browsers or old versions of Node, or as a convenient shortcut with temporary code or debugging operations. You may run into code that uses it, so you need to at least be aware of it.

### 3.6 Prototypal Inheritance vs Pseudo-classical Inheritance

Prototypal                                 | Pseudo-classical              | Both
-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------
prototypal delegation / object inheritance | constructor/prototype pattern | forms of inheritance
 create prototype objects with `Object.create()` (OLOO) to set the `[[Prototype]] property to inherit functions | use constructor function and `prototype` object to provide inheritance | use `[[Prototype]]` under the hood
 x | like classes without using a "class" |
 x | Using `class` and `extends` is a form of pseudo-classical inheritance |

As used in JavaScript, the term **inheritance** is an *overloaded word*. It describes two related but distinct forms of inheritance: **prototypal** and **pseudo-classical**.

The *simpler form of inheritance* is **prototypal inheritance** or **prototypal delegation**. We sometimes call this form of inheritance **object inheritance** since it works with one object at a time. An object's internal `[[Prototype]]` property points to another object, and the object can delegate method calls to that other object.

We've seen plenty of examples of prototypal inheritance in earlier assignments. For instance:

```js
let humanPrototype = {
  myName() { return this.name; },
  myAge() { return this.age; },
};

let personPrototype = Object.create(humanPrototype);
personPrototype.toString = function() {
  return `My name is ${this.myName()} and I'm ${this.myAge()} years old.`;
};

let will = Object.create(personPrototype);
will.name = 'William';
will.age = 28;
will.toString(); // => My name is William and I'm 28 years old.
```

Here, the `will` object inherits from the `personPrototype` object which, in turn, inherits from `humanPrototype`. `will`'s `[[Prototype]]` property refers to `personPrototype`, and the `[[Prototype]]` property of `personPrototype` refers to `humanPrototype`. When we invoke `toString`, it finds the methods `myName` and `myAge` on the `humanPrototype` object.

In this assignment, we've been using an object creation pattern called **pseudo-classical** object construction, also known as the **constructor/prototype pattern**. In this pattern, we use a constructor function and a prototype object to create objects and provide common methods for those objects. For instance:

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `My name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`;
}
```

The term "pseudo-classical" refers to the fact that *the pattern mimics classes from other OO languages but doesn't actually use classes*.

This pattern forms the basis of **pseudo-classical inheritance**, also called **constructor inheritance**. When people talk about inheritance in the context of JavaScript, they often mean this kind of inheritance. In pseudo-classical inheritance, a constructor's prototype object (the object referenced by its `prototype` property) inherits from another constructor's prototype. That is, *a subtype inherits from a supertype*.

For instance, we can *rewrite* the **prototypal inheritance** example to use **pseudo-classical inheritance**:

```js
function Human() {}
Human.prototype.myName = function() { return this.name; };
Human.prototype.myAge = function() { return this.age; };

function Person() {}
Person.prototype = Object.create(Human.prototype);
Person.prototype.constructor = Person;
Person.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `My name is ${this.myName()} and I'm ${this.myAge()} years old.`;
};

let will = new Person();
will.name = 'William';
will.age = 28;
will.toString(); // My name is William and I'm 28 years old.
```

Note that using `class` and the `extends` keyword is an alternative form of pseudo-classical inheritance. Here's what **pseudo-classical inheritance** looks like with `class` and `extends`:

```js
class Human {
  myName() { return this.name; }
  myAge() { return this.age; }
}

class Person extends Human {
  toString() {
    return `My name is ${this.myName()} and I'm ${this.myAge()} years old.`;
  }
}

let will = new Person();
will.name = 'William';
will.age = 28;
will.toString(); // => My name is William and I'm 28 years old.
```

Both pseudo-classical and prototypal inheritance *use prototypal delegation under the hood*. If the requested property isn't found, the object delegates the request to the object's prototype object. If the requested property isn't there either, the prototype object delegates the request to its own prototype object. This process follows the prototype chain until the property or method is found or the end of the prototype chain is found.

### 3.7 Prototypal Inheritance

It's all prototypal inheritance happening in the background, but you can leverage the constructor/prototype pattern to kind of mimic how traditional OOP languages deal with inheritance. So pseudo-classical means literally that, mimicking classical inheritance. The prototype chain, or prototypal inheritance, is how JavaScript inherits properties from other objects.

```js
let animal = {
  type: 'mammal',
  breathe: function() { 
    console.log("I'm breathing");
  },
}

let dog = Object.create(animal);

console.log(dog); // {}
console.log(dog.type); // "mammal"
console.log(dog.__proto__); // { type: 'mammal', breathe: ƒ }
console.log(dog.__proto__ === animal); // true
```

### 3.8 Inheritance with Class Declarations

In a prior assignment, we learned how one constructor's prototype can inherit from another constructor's prototype. For example:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

Rectangle.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Rectangle ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
};

function Square(size) {
  Rectangle.call(this, size, size);
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);
Square.prototype.constructor = Square;

Square.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
};
```

Let's convert that code to use classes instead of constructors and prototypes. The `Square` constructor's prototype inherits from `Rectangle.prototype`, which gives square objects access to methods defined for rectangle objects. We can do the same thing with classes, but we now use the clean, straightforward syntax provided for JavaScript classes:

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(length, width) {
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.width;
  }

  toString() {
    return `[Rectangle ${this.width * this.length}]`;
  }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(size) {
    super(size, size);
  }

  toString() {
    return `[Square] ${this.width * this.length}`;
  }
}
```

The `extends` keyword signifies that the class named to the left of `extends` should inherit from the class specified to the right of `extends`. Note that we don't define `getArea` on the `Square` class since `Square` inherits it from `Rectangle` and doesn't need to customize or override the method.

#### 3.8.1 `super`

Note also that the `Square` constructor calls a function that is represented by the keyword `super`. When called inside the `constructor` method, *the `super` keyword refers to the constructor method for the parent class* (the class that we inherit from). Thus, `super(size, size)` performs the same role performed by this code from our constructor/prototype example:

```js
function Square() {
  Rectangle.call(this, size, size);
}
```

You don't need to use `super` in every subclass, but in most cases you do. In particular, if the superclass's constructor creates any object properties, you must call `super` to ensure that those properties are set properly. For instance, in the `Rectangle` class above, we create two properties in the `Rectangle` constructor, so we must call `super` in `Square`'s constructor.

If you do call `super` in a subclass's constructor, you must *call it before you use* `this` in that constructor.

### 3.9 Inheritance with Class Expressions

Let's look at another example of inheritance with classes:

```js
let Person = class {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayName() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
};

let Student = class extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, semester) {
    super(name, age);
    this.semester = semester;
  }

  enrollInCourse(courseNumber) {
    console.log(`${this.name} has enrolled in course ${courseNumber}.`);
  }
};

let student = new Student('Kim', 22, 'Fall');
student.sayName(); // logs 'My name is Kim.'
student.enrollInCourse('JS120'); // logs 'Kim has enrolled in course JS120.'
```

In this example, the `Student` class inherits from the `Person` class. That gives student objects access to methods of the `Person` class and extends person objects further by adding a `semester` property and an `enrollInCourse` method. Notice that we've reused `Person`'s constructor inside the `Student` constructor, and calling `super` with `name` and `age` since the `Student` constructor expects those arguments. We also assign the `semester` argument to the `semester` property after `super` returns.

Note that this most recent example *uses class expressions instead of class declarations.*

## 4. Encapsulation

**Encapsulation** is the idea of bundling data and operations related to that data in a cohesive unit called an object.

In most OOP languages, encapsulation has a broader purpose. It also refers to restricting access to the state and certain behaviors; an object only exposes the data and behaviors that other parts of the application need to work. In other words, objects *expose a public interface* for interacting with other objects and keep their implementation details hidden. Thus, other objects can't change the data of an object without going through the proper interface. However, JavaScript does not directly provide the means to limit exposure of properties and methods.

This grouping together of related data and functions is what’s called **encapsulation** and is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

To illustrate, let’s take the following code:

```js
let overtime = 10;
let baseSalary = 6000;
let rate = 50;

function computeWage(baseSalary, overtime, rate) {
  return baseSalary + (overtime * rate)
}
```

Up top are the data related to the employee’s wage and a function that operates on the data. The object-oriented way of solving this problem by using encapsulation is done by simply *combining data and related functions into one unit* like so:

```js
let employee = {
  baseSalary: 6000,
  overtime: 10,
  rate: 50,
  computeWage: function() {
    return this.baseSalary + (this.overtime * this.rate)
  }
}
```

As you can see, everything that's related to the `employee` object is bundled. This is the beauty of object-oriented programming. It organizes code into logical units.

In the example given, we *instantiated an object using the object literal syntax*. There are other more sophisticated patterns of object creation that we'll cover over the remaining assignments. However keep in mind that, at the very core, we are essentially doing the same thing: *grouping data and related functions together*.

### 4.1 Encapsulating the data and functionality of a race car into an object

```js
let raceCar = {
  make: 'BMW',
  fuelLevel: 0.5, // <-- don't change property values directly
  engineOn: false,

  startEngine: function() {
    raceCar.engineOn = true;
  },

  drive: function() {
    raceCar.fuelLevel -= 0.1;
  },

  stopEngine() { // <-- compact method syntax that omits the `:` and the `function` keyword
    raceCar.engineOn = false;
  },

  refuel: function(percent) {
    if ((raceCar.fuelLevel + (percent / 100)) <= 1) {
      raceCar.fuelLevel += (percent / 100);
    } else {
      raceCar.fuelLevel = 1;
    }
  },
};

raceCar.refuel(30); // Use dot-notation to call a method.
```

This code bundles the data and operations related to a car into an object. When object properties have function values, we call them **methods**. The methods here are responsible for changing the state of the `raceCar` object.

JavaScript won't stop you from changing the `fuelLevel` property directly instead of calling the `refuel` method. That's a limitation of JavaScript. The OO style strongly discourages changing property values directly. Instead, it *encourages using methods to interface with the object*. We can see why that is by looking at the implementation for `refuel`. The `fuelLevel` property should be a number that's a fraction of 1. The `refuel` method ensures that it never exceeds that value. If you only use `refuel` to increase the `fuelLevel` of the car, it'll never exceed 1. If you directly access and change `fuelLevel`, though, you may end up violating that restriction.

## 5. Polymorphism

Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects with different types to respond to the same method invocation. In other words, *data of different types can respond to a common interface*. It's a crucial concept in OO programming that can lead to more maintainable code.

It can be implemented through inheritance by *method overriding*. It can also be implemented through **duck typing**; by ensuring that objects of different **types** *use the same method name to perform different but related functions*, those objects can be interacted with in a uniform way.

When two or more object types have a method with the same name, we can invoke that method with any of those objects. **When we don't care what type of object is calling the method, we're using polymorphism**. Often, polymorphism involves inheritance from a common superclass. However, inheritance isn't necessary as we'll see in this assignment.

For example, assume we have a method that expects an argument that has a `move` method. *We can pass it any type of argument, provided it has a compatible `move` method.* The object might represent a human, a cat, a jellyfish, or, conceivably, even a car or train. That is, it lets *objects of different types respond to the same method invocation.*

**Inheritance** and **duck-typing** are the two main ways to achieve polymorphism. When a method has the same name, but a different implementation in different classes it is called polymorphism. When a method in a subclass replaces the implementation of the version in the superclass, we say that the subclass *overrides* the version in the superclass. Subclasses that override methods inherited from a superclass is one way in which we can implement polymorphism in our applications.

### 5.1 Polymorphism through Inheritance

Examine the following code:

```js
class Animal {
  move() {}
}

class Fish extends Animal {
  move() {
    console.log("swimming");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  move() {
    console.log("walking");
  }
}

// Sponges and Corals don't have a separate move method - they don't move
class Sponge extends Animal {}
class Coral extends Animal {}

let animals = [new Fish(), new Cat(), new Sponge(), new Coral()];
animals.forEach(animal => animal.move());
```

Every object in the array is a different animal, but the client code -- the code that uses those objects -- doesn't care what each object is. The only thing it cares about here is that *each object in the array has a `move` method that requires no arguments*. That is, every generic animal object implements some form of locomotion, though some animals don't move. The interface for this class hierarchy lets us *work with all of those types in the same way even though the implementations may be dramatically different*. That is polymorphism.

If we run the above code, we call the `move` method for each of 4 different kinds of animal. Let's look at them in pairs.

The `Sponge` and `Coral` classes don't have a `move` method -- at least not one of their own. Instead, they both inherit it from the `Animal` class via the prototype chain. Thus, when we call `move` on a `Sponge` or `Coral` object, the `move` method in the `Animal` class gets called. That method does nothing here, so the `Sponge` or `Coral` doesn't move. *This is polymorphism through inheritance -- instead of providing our own behavior for the `move` method, we're using inheritance to acquire the behavior of a supertype.* In this case, that behavior does nothing, but *it could do something else*.

For `Fish` objects, we call the `move` method from the `Fish` class, which enables a fish to swim. Likewise, a `Cat` object walks when we tell it to `move`. This is a simple example of polymorphism in which two different object types can respond to the same method call simply by **overriding** a method inherited from a superclass. In a sense, overriding methods like this is similar to duck-typing, a concept that we'll meet shortly. However, *overriding is generally treated as an aspect of inheritance*, so this is polymorphism through inheritance.

An example of inheritance-based polymorphism in action is the JavaScript `toString` method. The `Object` type provides a default implementation of `toString()` that other types inherit. Other types can also override the method to return a customized string representation of the object. Without customization, `toString` returns the string `'[object Object]'` when called on an object. With customization, it can return something more meaningful and useful. For instance, arrays and dates are objects that have customized `toString` methods:

```js
> [1, 2, 3].toString()
'1,2,3'

> (new Date()).toString()
'Sun Mar 13 2022 10:51:46 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)'
```

### 5.1.1 Example of Inheritance-based Polymorphism - Objects are related through inheritance

```js
class Animal {
  speak() {}
}

class Dog {
  speak() { console.log("Woof!"); }
}

class Cat {
  speak() { console.log("Meow!"); }
}

class Fish() {
}

let dog = new Dog();
let cat = new Cat();
let fish = new Fish();

dog.speak(); // Woof!
cat.speak(); // Meow!
fish.speak(); // (nothing happens)
```

### 5.2 Polymorphism through Duck Typing

**Duck typing** occurs when objects of different *unrelated* types both respond to the same method name. With duck typing, we aren't concerned with the class or type of an object, but we do care whether an object has a particular behavior. *If an object quacks like a duck, then we can treat it as a duck*. Specifically, *duck typing is a form of polymorphism*. As long as the objects involved use the same method name and take the same number of arguments, we can treat the object as belonging to a specific category of objects.

For example, an application may have a variety of elements that can respond to a mouse click by calling a method named something like `handleClick`. Those elements may be completely different -- for instance, a checkbox vs. a text input field -- but they're all *clickable* objects. Duck typing is an informal way to classify or ascribe a type to objects. Classes and constructors provide a more formal way to do that.

Duck typing occurs when objects of different unrelated types both respond to the same method name.

[Distinction between Polymorphism and Duck Typing](https://launchschool.com/posts/c6a86a52#comment-89887)

Duck typing is just a particular form of polymorphism -- it's the ability for objects of completely unrelated types to respond to the same method invocation. A simple example of this in JavaScript are Strings and Arrays. These types are unrelated(*), yet they can both respond to, say, the `indexOf` method:

```js
let str = "abcde";
let arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];

console.log(str.indexOf("c")); // 2
console.log(arr.indexOf("c")); // 2
```

*In JS, almost all objects inherit from `Object` at some point in their prototype chain, so `String` and `Array` aren't completely unrelated. However, we usually ignore global supertypes (like `Object`) when talking about whether objects are related. It's still possible to create objects in JS that don't inherit from `Object`, and those objects can still use duck typing.

The main reason why there is a distinction is that some languages -- like C++ -- only support inheritance-based polymorphism. Two objects have to be related through inheritance for polymorphism to be present. When languages were introduced that allowed unrelated objects to act polymorphically, the term duck-typing was introduced to talk about that kind of polymorphism separately.

By other languages not supporting duck typing, does that mean that if you declare a method in an object, you can't use that same name to declare a method in another object?

You can use the same name, but languages that don't support duck typing don't let you call a method on unrelated objects like this:

```js
[str, arr].forEach(obj => console.log(obj.indexOf("c")));
```

Notice how we're calling both `str.indexOf` and `arr.indexOf` by using `obj.indexOf` where `obj` is alternately a reference to `str` or `arr`.

You can do that with a duck-typed language, but if you try it in a language like C that doesn't support duck typing, it will produce a type error. You can't call methods for 2 or more objects with the same line of code unless the objects have a common superclass. It's much more stringent than JS and Ruby. However, you can still call things that have the same method, just not through a common interface.

By the way -- calling `indexOf` like this with a variable that can take on different types is where polymorphism really comes into play. I'm not sure if we emphasize that enough. The point behind polymorphism is that you can write code that doesn't care about types -- just that the different things respond to the same message.

### 5.3 In the next example, we define a `Wedding` class and several preparer classes. The example attempts to implement polymorphic behavior without using duck typing; it shows you ***how you shouldn't do it***!

```js
class Chef {
  prepareFood(guests) {
    // implementation
  }
}

class Decorator {
  decoratePlace(flowers) {
    // implementation
  }
}

class Musician {
  preparePerformance(songs) {
    // implementation
  }
}

class Wedding {
  constructor(guests, flowers, songs) {
    this.guests = guests;
    this.flowers = flowers;
    this.songs = songs;
  }

  prepare(preparers) {
    preparers.forEach(preparer => {
      if (preparer instanceof Chef) {
        preparer.prepareFood(this.guests);
      } else if (preparer instanceof Decorator) {
        preparer.decoratePlace(this.flowers);
      } else if (preparer instanceof Musician) {
        preparer.preparePerformance(this.songs);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

The problem with this code is that *the `prepare` method has too many dependencies*; it relies on specific classes and their names. It also needs to know which method it should call on each type of object, as well as the arguments that each method requires. If you change the way any of those methods are used or add a new type of preparer, you must also change `Wedding.prototype.prepare`. For instance, if we need to add a dressmaker, we must add another else clause. With only 4 preparers, `prepare` is already becoming long and messy.

The right way to implement this program is to *use duck typing to implement polymorphism*:

```js
class Chef {
  prepare(wedding) {
    this.prepareFood(wedding.guests);
  }

  prepareFood(guests) {
    // implementation
  }
}

class Decorator {
  prepare(wedding) {
    this.decoratePlace(wedding.flowers);
  }

  decoratePlace(flowers) {
    // implementation
  }
}

class Musician {
  prepare(wedding) {
    this.preparePerformance(wedding.songs);
  }

  preparePerformance(songs) {
    // implementation
  }
}

class Wedding {
  constructor(guests, flowers, songs) {
    this.guests = guests;
    this.flowers = flowers;
    this.songs = songs;
  }

  prepare(preparers) {
    preparers.forEach(preparer => {
      preparer.prepare(this);
    });
  }
}
```

Though there is no inheritance in this example, each of the preparer-type classes provides a `prepare` method. We still have polymorphism since all of the objects respond to the `prepare` method call. If we later need to add another preparer type, we can create another class and implement the `prepare` method to perform the appropriate actions.

### 5.4 Synora Eusebio (JS129)

For anyone that’s interested, I wrote out a full implementation of the Polymorphism via Duck Typing example. I had to rework the `prepare` method in the Wedding constructor in order to get that specific method to work.

```js
class Chef {
  constructor(guests, flowers, songs) {
    this.guests = guests;
    this.flowers = flowers;
    this.songs = songs;
  }
  prepare(wedding) {
    return this.prepareFood(wedding.guests);
  }

  prepareFood(guests) {
    return `Prepare food for ${this.guests} guests!`;
  }
}

let chef = new Chef(200, 'tulips', ["Electric Slide", "Cha-Cha Slide"]);
console.log(chef);
/*
Chef {
  guests: 200,
  flowers: 'tulips',
  songs: [ 'Electric Slide', 'Cha-Cha Slide' ]
}
*/
console.log(chef.prepare(chef.guests)); // Prepare food for 200 guests!
console.log(chef.prepareFood(chef.guests)); // Prepare food for 200 guests!

class Decorator {
  constructor(guests, flowers, songs){
    this.guests = guests;
    this.flowers = flowers;
    this.song = songs;
  }
  prepare(wedding) {
    return this.decoratePlace(wedding.flowers);
  }

  decoratePlace(flowers) {
    return `Where are my ${this.flowers}??`;
  }
}

let decorator = new Decorator(300, 'roses', ["Electric Slide", "Cha-Cha Slide"]);
console.log(decorator);
/*
Decorator {
  guests: 300,
  flowers: 'roses',
  song: [ 'Electric Slide', 'Cha-Cha Slide' ]
}
*/
console.log(decorator.prepare(decorator.flowers)); //Where are my roses??
console.log(decorator.decoratePlace(decorator.flowers)); //Where are my roses??

class Musician {
  constructor(guests, flowers, songs) {
    this.guests = guests;
    this.flowers = flowers; 
    this.songs = songs;
  }
  prepare(wedding) {
    return this.preparePerformance(wedding.songs);
  }

  preparePerformance(songs) {
    return `Prepare the following songs: ${this.songs}`;
  };
}

let musician = new Musician (400, 'carnations', ["Electric Slide", "Cha-Cha Slide"]);
console.log(musician);
/*
Musician {
  guests: 400,
  flowers: 'carnations',
  songs: [ 'Electric Slide', 'Cha-Cha Slide' ]
}
*/
console.log(musician.prepare(musician.songs)); // Prepare the following songs: Electric Slide,Cha-Cha Slide
console.log(musician.preparePerformance(musician.songs)); // Prepare the following songs: Electric Slide,Cha-Cha Slide

class Wedding {
  constructor(guests, flowers, songs) {
    this.guests = guests;
    this.flowers = flowers;
    this.songs = songs;
  }

  prepare(preparers) {
    preparers.forEach(preparer => console.log(preparer));
  }
}

let wedding = new Wedding (400, 'daisy', ["Electric Slide", "Cha-Cha Slide"]);

console.log(wedding);
/*
Wedding {
  guests: 400,
  flowers: 'daisy',
  songs: [ 'Electric Slide', 'Cha-Cha Slide' ]
}
*/

wedding.prepare([chef.prepare(chef.guests), decorator.prepare(decorator.flowers), (musician.prepare(musician.songs))]);
/*
Prepare food for 200 guests!
Where are my roses??
Prepare the following songs: Electric Slide,Cha-Cha Slide
*/
```

### 5.5 Polymorphism Requires Intention

Note that merely having two different objects that have a method with the same name and compatible arguments *doesn't mean that you have polymorphism*. In theory, those methods might be used polymorphically, but that doesn't always make sense. Consider the following two classes:

```js
class Circle {
  draw() {}
}

class Blinds {
  draw() {}
}
```

These classes each have a method named `draw`, and the methods take no arguments. In the `Circle` class, `draw` presumably draws a circle on the screen. In the `Blinds` class, `draw` may cause the window blinds in an office building to be drawn (as in close or open). In theory, you could write some code that uses these methods polymorphically:

```js
[new Circle(), new Blinds()].forEach(obj => obj.draw());
```

However, it's unlikely that this would ever make sense in real code. Unless you're actually calling the method in a polymorphic manner, you don't have polymorphism. In practice, polymorphic methods are *intentionally designed to be polymorphic*; if there's no intention, you probably shouldn't use them polymorphically.

## 6. Collaborator Objects

Objects that *help provide state within another object* are called **collaborator objects**, or more simply **collaborators**. Objects *collaborate* with other objects by using them as part of their **state**. We say that two objects have a **collaborator relationship** *if one of them is part of the state of the other*.

Collaboration is all about objects working together in some manner. A collaborator works in conjunction -- in collaboration -- with another object. Collaborator objects let you chop up and modularize the problem domain into cohesive pieces. They play an important role in modeling complicated problem domains in OO programming.

```js
let cat = {
  name: 'Fluffy',

  makeNoise() {
    console.log('Meow! Meow!');
  },

  eat() {
    // implementation
  },
};

let pete = {
  name: 'Pete',
  pet: cat, // <-- `cat` collaborator object stored in the `pet` property of the `pete` object

  printName() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}!`);
    console.log(`My pet's name is ${this.pet.name}`); // line 19
  },
};

pete.printName();
// => My name is Pete!
// => My pet's name is Fluffy
```

The `pete` object has the collaborator object `cat` stored in its `pet` property. The `pete` object and the object referenced by its `pet` property work together. When we need to access the `pet` object or have it perform a behavior, we can use `pete.pet` to access and use the object's properties. For instance, on line 19, the `pete` object collaborates with the `cat` object (via `this.pet`) to access the `cat`'s name.

Collaborator objects play an important role in object-oriented design; they *represent the connections between the different classes* in your program. When working on an object-oriented program, be sure to consider what collaborators your objects need and whether those associations make sense, both from a technical standpoint and in terms of modeling the problem your program aims to solve.

Let's now develop our program further and change the implementation to let Pete have many pets. How should we implement this? How about an array of `pet` objects?

```js
let cat = {
  name: 'Fluffy',

  makeNoise() {
    console.log('Meow! Meow!');
  },

  eat() {
    // implementation
  },
};

let dog = {
  name: 'Maxi',

  makeNoise() {
    console.log('Woof! Woof!');
  },

  eat() {
    // implementation
  },
};

let pete = {
  name: 'Pete',
  pets: [],
};

pete.pets.push(cat);
pete.pets.push(dog);
```

We often talk of collaborators in the context of custom objects like `pet`, but collaborators don't have to be custom objects. They can be built-in objects like arrays and dates, as well.

## 7. Single vs Multiple Inheritance

In JavaScript objects can only inherit from one object, and classes can extend only one other class. In other words, an object can have only one prototype object. This is **single inheritance**.

Some programming languages allow classes to inherit from multiple classes, a functionality known as multiple inheritance. JavaScript doesn't support **multiple inheritance**, so a class can only inherit from one class.

To be clear, when we say that an object can only have one prototype or that a class can only inherit from one class, we don't mean that the object or class can't inherit from an entire chain of prototypes or classes. It's perfectly acceptable for a `Whale` class to inherit from a `Mammal` class, which in turn inherits from an `Animal` class, which again inherits from the built-in `Object` type. Some students see this as multiple inheritance, but it is not: each object or class inherits directly from a single thing, so it is **single inheritance**. The chain of prototypes or superclasses merely comes along for the ride.

## 8. Mixins; mixins vs. inheritance

### 8.1 Introduction

One problem with inheritance in JavaScript is that *objects can inherit from only one object, and classes can extend only one other class*. In other words, an object can have only one prototype object. We call this **single inheritance**.

This limitation makes it difficult to model certain domains using class or constructor-based inheritance. For instance, suppose we have a `Pet` class from which several other specific classes inherit. The inheritance relationship might look like this:

![inheritance-relationship](object_hierarchy_with_mixins.png)

Note that the `swim` method is in two classes: `Dog` and `Fish`. Assuming that they have the same implementation, we would like to provide that method in one place, perhaps in a class. However, where can we move it? Some programming languages allow classes to inherit from multiple classes, a functionality known as multiple inheritance. JavaScript doesn't support **multiple inheritance**, so a class can only inherit from one class.

### 8.2 Mixins

Enter JavaScript mixins – a pattern that adds methods and properties from one object to another. It's not delegation with prototypes; *the mixin pattern merely copies the properties of one object to another with `Object.assign` or some similar technique.*

JavaScript doesn't support multiple inheritance, but the mix-in pattern helps developers overcome this limitation and get some of the benefits of multiple inheritance in an environment that only supports single inheritance.

For now, we're concerned with objects that can, in principle, belong to multiple and distinct types. For instance, in the bird world, there are birds that can swim and birds that can fly, but there are also birds that can't swim and birds that can't fly. Some birds can even do both.

**Bird** | **Swim?** | **Fly?**
---------|-----------|---------
Stork    | no        | yes
Parrot   | no        | yes
Penguin  | yes       | no
Ostrich  | yes       | no
Duck     | yes       | yes
Goose    | yes       | yes

How would we model this in JavaScript with inheritance? We start like this:

```js
class Bird {}

class Stork extends Bird {
  fly() {}
}

class Parrot extends Bird {
  fly() {}
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
  swim() {}
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
  swim() {}
}

class Duck extends Bird {
  fly() {}
  swim() {}
}

class Goose extends Bird {
  fly() {}
  swim() {}
}
```

There's a lot of duplication going on here: 4 of the various bird classes each have their own copy of the `swim` method, while 4 have their own copy of the `fly` method. In all likelihood, those 4 `fly` methods are identical, as are the 4 `swim` methods.

One way we can try to reduce the duplication is by using inheritance and a new class. Let's start with the `fly` method. We can define a `FlyingBird` type to handle this:

```js
class Bird {}

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
  fly() {}
}

class Stork extends FlyingBird {}

class Parrot extends FlyingBird {}

class Penguin extends Bird {
  swim() {}
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
  swim() {}
}

class Duck extends FlyingBird {
  swim() {}
}

class Goose extends FlyingBird {
  swim() {}
}
```

Great! Let's see what happens when we try to refactor the `swim` method:

```js
class Bird {}

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
  fly() {}
}

class SwimmingBird extends Bird {
  swim() {}
}

class Stork extends FlyingBird {}

class Parrot extends FlyingBird {}

class Penguin extends SwimmingBird {}

class Ostrich extends SwimmingBird {}

// Hmmm.... we have a problem.
// What to do with ducks and geese???

class Duck extends FlyingBird {
  swim() {}
}

class Goose extends FlyingBird {
  swim() {}
}
```

We've hit a roadblock. The `Duck` and `Goose` classes represent both flying birds and swimming birds, but JavaScript only allows single inheritance. The lack of support for multiple inheritance means we can't just add a new class in and inherit from it.

Instead of using inheritance, we can use a **mixin** instead. A mixin is an object that defines one or more methods that can be "mixed-in" to a class. This grants that class access to all of the methods in the object. It's the only real workaround for the lack of multiple inheritance short of duplication. Let's see what mixins look like:

```js
const Swimmable = {
  swim() {};
}

class Bird {}

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
  fly() {}
}

class Stork extends FlyingBird {}

class Parrot extends FlyingBird {}

class Penguin extends Bird {}
Object.assign(Penguin.prototype, Swimmable);

class Ostrich extends Bird {}
Object.assign(Ostrich.prototype, Swimmable);

class Duck extends FlyingBird {}
Object.assign(Duck.prototype, Swimmable);

class Goose extends FlyingBird {}
Object.assign(Goose.prototype, Swimmable);
```

In this code, we've created a `Swimmable` object that has a `swim` method. To mix it into our various swimming birds, we've used `Object.assign` to add the methods from `Swimmable` to the prototype objects of those classes. It's a bit tedious, but not too difficult, and it works well.

For consistency, we could even *eliminate the inheritance aspect entirely*:

```js
const Swimmable = {
  swim() {}
}

const Flyable = {
  fly() {}
}

class Stork {}
Object.assign(Stork.prototype, Flyable);

class Parrot {}
Object.assign(Parrot.prototype, Flyable);

class Penguin {}
Object.assign(Penguin.prototype, Swimmable);

class Ostrich {}
Object.assign(Ostrich.prototype, Swimmable);

class Duck {}
Object.assign(Duck.prototype, Swimmable, Flyable);

class Goose {}
Object.assign(Goose.prototype, Swimmable, Flyable);
```

### 8.3 Mixins vs Inheritance

Some JavaScript developers argue that you should use factory functions with mixins exclusively. They suggest that inheritance fails at modeling some scenarios, but a combination of factory functions and mixins can model any object relationship. Why bother with class/constructor inheritance at all? Why not just use factory functions that mix in other objects instead? If we did that, we could *rewrite our example like this*:

```js
const Swimmable = {
  swim() {}
}

const Flyable = {
  fly() {}
}

function createFlyingBird() {
  return Object.assign({}, Flyable);
}

function createSwimmingBird() {
  return Object.assign({}, Swimmable);
}

function createTalentedBird() {
  return Object.assign({}, Swimmable, Flyable);
}

function createStork() {
  return createFlyingBird();
}

function createParrot() {
  return createFlyingBird();
}

function createPenguin() {
  return createSwimmingBird();
}

function createOstrich() {
  return createSwimmingBird();
}

function createDuck() {
  return createTalentedBird();
}

function createGoose() {
  return createTalentedBird();
}
```

This approach is valid, but it suffers the *downsides of all factory functions*:

1. Every new object receives a new copy of all of its methods, including new copies of both mixin methods and the methods that belong more directly to the object. That can be taxing on memory resources, even more so than the memory requirements of mixins.

2. You can't determine the type of an object created with a factory function: the `instanceof` operator only recognizes these objects as instances of the `Object` type. As far as JavaScript is concerned, a penguin and a fish and an automobile are indistinguishable. That's not as troubling as it might sound in terms of being able to solve programming problems, but it has a more significant impact on debugging.

We *suggest a balance of mix-in and classical inheritance* pattern instead:

1. Inheritance works well when one object type is positively a subtype of another object. In our example, it's natural for a penguin to also be a swimming bird. These types have an **is a** relationship: a penguin *is a* swimming bird. *Whenever two object types have an "is a" relationship, constructor or class inheritance makes sense.*

2. On the other hand, the ability to swim doesn't have that kind of relationship with storks. Swimming is a capability that penguins have. Similarly, flying is a capability that storks have. *When you want to endow your objects with some capability, a mixin may be the correct choice.*

Mixins are more appropriate in a *has-a* relationship. While it is sometimes tricky to choose one or the other, *a great guideline is to decide if you want some additional functionality, or if you want to extend the abilities of the class.*

Inheritance works best when there is an "is a" relationship between two classes. The inheriting class is a type of the superclass. The mixin pattern works best when an object has a capability that another object needs.

Relationship | Use         | Because
-------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------
"is-a"       | inheritance | you want to extend the abilities of a class
"has-a"      | mixin       | you want additional functionality

## 9. Methods and Functions; Method Invocation vs. Function Invocation

### 9.1 Methods on `Object.prototype`

The `Object.prototype` object is at the top of all JavaScript prototype chains. Thus, its methods are available from any JavaScript object provided you don't explicitly use something like `null` as the prototype object. Here are 3 useful methods:

- `Object.prototype.toString()` returns a string representation of the object.

- `Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(obj)` determines whether the object is part of another object's prototype chain.

- Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty(prop) determines whether the object contains the property.

### 9.2 Objects Without Prototypes (bare objects)

There is a way to create objects that don't have a prototype and, hence, do not have a prototype chain that ends with `Object.prototype`. You *can* create an object that doesn't have a prototype by setting the prototype to `null`. This technique is a bit unusual and not seen very often. However, it lets you create a "clean" or "bare" object for use as a general key/value data structure. The bare object doesn't carry around a bunch of excess baggage in the form of unneeded properties and prototypes:

```sh
> let a = Object.create(null)
undefined

> Object.getPrototypeOf(a)
null
```

Note that objects created in this way do not have access to Object methods like `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()` or `Object.prototype.toString()`. They also don't have a prototype chain that ends with `Object.prototype` -- *it ends with `null`*.

For the most part, you can *assume that all JavaScript objects have* `Object.prototype` at the top of their inheritance chain. You can also assume that all objects can use the usual selection of Object properties. However, be wary of situations where bare objects may be in use. If you have bare objects in your program, you must remember that the usual `Object` properties and methods don't exist on those objects. That's why you sometimes see code like this:

```js
if (Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) && obj.isPrototypeOf(car)) {
  // obj has a non-null prototype AND
  // obj is in the prototype chain of car
}
```

If you don't first check whether `obj` has a non-`null` prototype, this code will raise an exception if `obj` has a `null` prototype. Even this code won't work properly if `obj` inherits from an object whose prototype is `null`.

Library developers often write code to check for the **bare object edge cases**. Since their code will see use in many different environments, they need to be ready for such unusual objects.

### 9.3 Method Invocation vs Function Invocation

**Function invocations** (e.g., `parseInt(numberString)`) rely upon implicit execution context that resolves to the global object.

**Method invocations** (e.g., `array.forEach(processElement)`) rely upon implicit context that resolves to the object that holds the method.

## 10. Higher-order functions

A function that accepts one or more arguments that are themselves functions is a higher-order function. A function that returns a function is a higher-order function. Higher-order functions are also first-class values.

All JavaScript functions are first-class values. Therefore, all higher-order functions are also first-class values.

JavaScript has first-class functions that have the following characteristics:

- You can add them to objects and execute them in the respective object's context.
- You can remove them from their objects, pass them around, and execute them in entirely different contexts.
- They're initially unbound but dynamically bound to a context object at execution time.

### 10.1 Function Declarations vs Function Expressions

Take a look at the following function definition.

```js
// function declaration
function prompt(message) {
  console.log(`=> ${message}`);
}
```

Functions defined with this syntax *can be invoked before the declaration in the program*:

```js
prompt('How are you today?');

function prompt(message) {
  console.log(`=> ${message}`);
}
```

This code works since *the JavaScript engine runs our code in two passes*. During the first pass, it does some preparatory work, while the second executes the code. One action that occurs during the first pass is called **hoisting**; *the engine effectively moves function declarations to the top of the program file in which they're defined, or the top of the function in which they are nested.* The result is that the above code acts as though you wrote it like this:

```js
function prompt(message) {
  console.log(`=> ${message}`);
}

prompt('How are you today?');
```

### 10.1.1 Hoisting

Note that you'll never see this hoisted code when working with JavaScript. *Hoisting is an internal step performed by the engine*; it doesn't move any code around. However, it's useful to think of hoisting in this way, so long as you understand that your code is not changed.

Function definitions that are the first thing on a line are known as **function declarations**. On the other hand, **function expressions** are function definitions that are part of an expression. For instance, the code in the above example shows `prompt` as a function declaration; the next example shows `foo` as a function expression: it is *not* a declaration.

```js
(function foo() {

})
```

You can test whether a function definition is a function declaration by trying to call it before the declaration. You can't call a function expression until after the expression is evaluated:

```js
// NOTE: Run this code from a file; don't use the REPL

bar();
function bar() {
  console.log("this is bar");
}
// => 'this is bar'

foo();
const foo = function() {
  console.log("this is foo");
};
// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'foo' before initialization
```

Typically, we assign a function expression to a variable or object property, pass it to another function, or return it to a calling function. For instance:

```js
let prompt = function() {}; // Assign to a variable

[1, 2, 3].forEach(function(elem) { // pass to another function
  console.log(elem);
});


function makeIncrementer(increment) {
  return function(value) { // return to caller
    return value + increment;
  }
}
```

### 10.1.2 Anonymous Functions

Notice that we can define function expressions without giving them a name. You may argue that `prompt` is the name of the function we defined on line 1, but that's not the case: instead, we've *assigned an unnamed function to the prompt variable*. Such unnamed functions are called **anonymous functions**. Anonymous functions are commonplace in JavaScript code, so be prepared to understand them. You've already seen examples with the callback functions for array methods like `forEach` and `map`: the callback functions for these methods are often anonymous functions.

```js
let squaredNums = [1, 2, 3].map(function(num) {
  return num * num;
}); // => [1, 4, 9]
```

Function expressions don't have to be anonymous. *You can name a function expression*:

```js
let squaredNums = [1, 2, 3].map(function squareNum(num) {
  return num * num;
}); // => [1, 4, 9]
```

The main advantage of naming a function expression occurs when the function throws an error (raises an exception). If the function has a name, the stack trace uses that name to help you determine where the error occurred. Without the name, JavaScript merely reports the location as "anonymous."

The function name given to a function expression is **not visible** in the scope that includes the function expression.

```js
let foo = function bar() {};
foo();         // This works
bar();         // This does not work (line 3)
```

`foo` is a local variable that contains a reference to the function, so we can invoke the function using `foo()`. However, the function name, `bar`, is not in scope on line 3, so `bar()` does not work.

The function name on a function expression is visible inside the function, which is useful when working with recursive functions. We won't trouble you with an example at this time.

### 10.2. Arrow Functions

There's no declaration syntax for arrow functions; *arrow functions are always function expressions*. That means that we often pass them around or assign them to variables or properties. Also, *arrow functions are always anonymous*: there's no way to define a named arrow function. Arrow functions are either immediately invoked, assigned to variables or properties, or passed around as arguments and return values.

### 10.3 First-Class Functions

You'll often see the phrase **first-class functions** or **first-class objects** when discussing JavaScript functions. It merely refers to the fact that functions in JavaScript are values that we can assign to variables and properties, pass them to other functions, or return them from another function.

Functions of all kinds, including declared functions, can be treated as values:

```js
function say(words) {
  console.log(words);
}

let speak = say;

speak('Howdy!');   // logs 'Howdy'
```

In this example, we declare a function `say()` and then assign it to the variable `speak`. We then invoke the function using `speak` as a handle. Note that we can still call the function using `say` as well -- both `say` and `speak` refer to the same function.

Here's another example:

```js
function logNum(num) {
  console.log('Number: ' + num);
}

[1, 2, 3].forEach(logNum);
// Number: 1
// Number: 2
// Number: 3
```

In this case, we're passing the function `logNum()` as an argument to the `forEach` method, which calls it three times. With each invocation of `logNum`, `forEach` passes it one of the array elements as an argument.

Notice that *we don't use invocation syntax*, `()`, when passing `logNum` as an argument to `forEach`. If we did, it would throw a `TypeError` exception since `forEach` expects a function; instead of passing a function, though, we would be passing `undefined`, the return value of `logNum()`.

```js
function logNum(num) {
  console.log('Number: ' + num);
}

[1, 2, 3].forEach(logNum());
// Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
```

The takeaway is that you *should not invoke functions when you want to use them as* **values**. Use invocation only when you need to run the code in the function.

Let's return to the following example:

```js
function logNum(num) {
  console.log('Number: ' + num);
}

[1, 2, 3].forEach(logNum);
// Number: 1
// Number: 2
// Number: 3
```

This code is functionally identical to the following code:

```js
[1, 2, 3].forEach(function logNum(num) {
  console.log('Number: ' + num);
});
```

The only difference is that we're *using a function expression* instead of a variable.

We can also *use an arrow function* to do the same thing:

```js
[1, 2, 3].forEach(num => {
  console.log('Number: ' + num);
});
```

In this case, though, the function is anonymous. The results, however, are identical.

The point we want you to remember is that you can *treat any function as you would any other JavaScript value: remove the invocation syntax, and you've got an expression whose value is a function*. You can do whatever you want with that value (at least within the limits of what JavaScript can do).

### 10.4. Type of a Function Value

Since functions are first-class values in JavaScript, and all values in JavaScript have a type, functions must also have a type. Right? That's correct! Let's use the handy `typeof` operator to determine the type of a function value:

```js
let myFunc = function() {};
console.log(typeof myFunc); // 'function'
```

### 10.5 Function Expressions Summary

Functions in JavaScript are first-class values, just like any other value in JavaScript. You can use them any place that you can use an expression. To use a function as an expression, write its name without the parentheses of invocation. All functions have a type of `function`, which is a kind of object with properties and methods.

## 10.6 Higher Order Functions

The fact that JavaScript treats functions as values means that we can have a special kind of function in our programs: a **higher-order function**. A higher-order function is a function that has *at least one of the following properties*:

1. It takes a function as an argument.
2. It returns a function.

Higher-order functions let the programmer use powerful and flexible abstractions.

### 10.6.1 Higher Order Functions - Functions that Accept Functions as Arguments

We've seen many examples of functions that have the first property. Specifically, array methods like `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` each take a function argument.

Let's pretend that we don't have a `map` method on JavaScript arrays. If we want to implement some code that squares all the elements of an array, we'd probably come up with something like this:

```js
function mapNumsToSquares(nums) {
  let squaredArray = [];

  for (let index = 0; index < nums.length; index++) {
    let current = nums[index];
    squaredArray.push(current * current); // line 6
  }

  return squaredArray;
}
```

This approach is valid, and you'll see functions like this in languages that don't have first-class functions (nor the closely related concept of lambdas). However, squaring the numbers in an array almost certainly won't be the only type of mapping you'll need in your application. Suppose that we need another function that uppercases all the elements in an array of strings. The solution may look like this:

```js
function uppercaseStrings(strings) {
  let capStrings = [];

  for (let index = 0; index < strings.length; index++) {
    let current = strings[index];
    capStrings.push(current.toUpperCase()); // line 6
  }

  return capStrings;
}
```

The only significant difference between these two functions is line 6 of each function where we either square a number or uppercase a string; everything else follows the same general structure:

- Declare and initialize the result array.
- Iterate over the input array.
  - Add mapped values to the result.
- Return the result.

Can we abstract away the similar structure of the two functions and leave the specific mapping operation up to the function's caller to decide? That's what `map` does for us: *it abstracts away the mechanics of mapping an array and leaves the details for the developer to provide at runtime.* She does that by providing a function as an argument. The result is much more powerful and versatile:

```js
arrayOfNums.map(num => num * num);
arrayOfStrings.map(string => string.toUpperCase());
```

The `map` method, along with several other array methods, is a higher-order function since it takes another function as an argument.

### 10.6.2 Higher Order Functions - Functions that Return a Function

You can think of a function that returns another function as a function factory: it creates and returns a new function. Typically, the function factory uses the arguments you pass to it to determine the specific job performed by the function it returns.

To truly appreciate how useful this is, you need to understand closure; we're not ready for that, though -- we'll discuss the topic later. For now, we can use a contrived example to demonstrate the mechanics of functions returning other functions. Let's use a simple `greeter` function as an example, one that can log greetings in multiple languages:

```js
function greet(language) {
  switch (language) {
    case 'en':
      console.log('Hello!');
      break;
    case 'es':
      console.log('Hola!');
      break;
    case 'fr':
      console.log('Bonjour!');
  }
}

greet('fr'); // logs 'Bonjour!'
```

This implementation works, but if we're using a particular language over and over, we need to provide the language string every time. That's not a big deal, but it would be useful if we only had to provide the language once. Instead of a `greet` function, let's implement a greeter factory that lets us create a greeter function for a given language.

```js
function createGreeter(language) {
  switch (language) {
    case 'en':
      return () => console.log('Hello!');
    case 'es':
      return () => console.log('Hola!');
    case 'fr':
      return () => console.log('Bonjour!');
  }
}

let greeterEs = createGreeter('es');
greeterEs(); // logs 'Hola!'
greeterEs(); // logs 'Hola!'
greeterEs(); // logs 'Hola!'

let greeterEn = createGreeter('en');
greeterEn(); // logs 'Hello!'
```

This code doesn't provide a significant improvement or convenience for the developer, but it does illustrate how we might use a function that returns another function in our code.

## 11. The Global Object

JavaScript creates a **global object** when it starts running. It serves as the **implicit execution context** for function invocations. In Node.js, the global object is the object named `global`; in the browser, it's the `window` object.

The global object is available everywhere in your program and houses important global properties. In the previous course, we talked about **global values** such as `Infinity` and `NaN`, and **global functions**, such as `isNaN` and `parseInt`. All these entities are properties of the global object.

In your console, you can look at the global object to examine those properties.

```sh
> global.isNaN      // [Function: isNaN]
> global.Infinity   // Infinity
```

Note: don't use `isNaN` in your code. Use `Number.isNaN` instead. The bare `isNaN` function has some odd behavior:

```sh
Number.isNaN('I am not a number');   // false - this is a correct value
isNaN('I am not a number');          // true - string gets coerced to NaN
```

As with other JavaScript objects, *you can add properties to the global object at any time*:

```sh
// in Node
> global.foo = 1
> global.foo       // 1
```

```sh
// in a browser
> window.foo = 1
> window.foo       // 1
```

### 11.1 The Global Object and Undeclared Variables

The global object has an interesting property: whenever you assign a value to a variable without using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords, *the variable gets added to the global object as a property*. Let's see an example:

```js
foo = 'bar';
global.foo; // => 'bar' (in Node)
window.foo; // => 'bar' (in a browser)
```

Without a keyword, *the variable gets added to the global object as a property*. You can even access such variables without using the global object as the caller:

```js
foo = 'bar';
foo; // line 2 => 'bar'
```

Whenever you try to access a variable for which there are no local or global variables with the variable's name, JavaScript looks at the global object and looks for a property with that name. In this example, since there are no local or global variables named `foo`, JavaScript looks in the global object and finds the `foo` property. As a result, line `2` is identical to `global.foo`; *it returns the value of the property `foo` from the global object*.

We discuss the global object here since you need to know where JavaScript gets all those global entities like `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `setTimeout`. It's not very often that you'll need to modify the global object, but you'll sometimes use it to set properties in Node that you need in multiple modules. We'll discuss Node modules in the next course.

## 12. Method and Property Lookup Sequence in the Prototype Chain

When you access a property on an object, JavaScript first looks for an "own" property with that name on the object. If the object does not define the specified property, JavaScript looks for it in the object's prototype. If it can't find the property there, it next looks in the prototype's prototype. This process continues until it finds the property or it reaches `Object.prototype`. If `Object.prototype` also doesn't define the property, the property access evaluates to `undefined`.

The implication here is that when two objects in the same prototype chain have a property with the same name, *the object that's closer to the calling object takes precedence.*

Let's see an example:

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
};

let b = {
  foo: 2,
};

Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a);

let c = Object.create(b);
console.log(c.foo); // => 2;
```

How about *setting a property*? What do you think happens when we set the `foo` property on object `c` to a different value?

```js
c.foo = 42;
```

Is `b.foo` assigned to `42` by this code? How can you test that in node?

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
};

let b = {
  foo: 2,
};

Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a);

let c = Object.create(b);
console.log(c.foo); // => 2
c.foo = 42;
console.log(c.foo); // => 42
console.log(b.foo); // => 2
```

Object `b` *wasn't mutated!* When assigning a property on a JavaScript object, *it always treats the property as an "own" property*. That is, it assumes that the property belongs to the object named to the left of the property name. Even if the prototype chain already has a property with that name, it assigns the "own" property. Here, `foo` becomes an "own" property of `c`:

```js
console.log(c.hasOwnProperty('foo')); // => true
```

The discussion of inheriting *properties* from other objects *applies to methods as well*. Methods in JavaScript are merely *properties that refer to functions*. Thus, when we talk about object properties, we also mean methods.

## 13. Function Execution Context and `this`

You can *access the properties and methods of an object from within a method* using the `this` keyword. The `this` keyword lets us refer to the properties and methods of the object. Inside the methods, the `this` keyword lets us refer to the properties and other methods of the object. So, the `this` keyword is basically a dynamic pointer whose value depends on where it's being referenced and how.

Thus far in our example, we refer to the object from inside the methods by directly using the variable name, `raceCar`. Suppose we change the variable name or pass the object to a function that refers to its arguments by a different name. In that case, calling a method with the original variable name will *throw a reference error*. We need some way to refer to the object that contains a method from other methods in that object. The keyword `this` provides the desired functionality:

```js
let raceCar = {

  make: 'BMW',
  fuelLevel: 0.5,
  engineOn: false,

  startEngine() {
    this.engineOn = true;
  },

  drive() {
    this.fuelLevel -= 0.1;
  },

  stopEngine() {
    this.engineOn = false;
  },

  refuel(percent) {
    if ((this.fuelLevel + (percent / 100)) <= 1) {
      this.fuelLevel += (percent / 100);
    } else {
      this.fuelLevel = 1;
    }
  },
};
```

### What is `this`?

The value of `this` is the current execution context of a function or method. The value of `this` *changes based on how you invoke a function*, not how you define it.

The JavaScript `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used:

- Alone, `this` refers to the **global object**.
- In a function, `this` refers to the **global object**.
- In a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.
- In a method, `this` refers to the calling object.
- Method calls like `call()`, and `apply()` can refer `this` to any object.
- In an event, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event.

### When does JavaScript bind an object to `this`?

- It binds the execution context when the function is executed using **method call syntax**, e.g., `foo.bar()`. A function that is invoked using method-call syntax receives the calling object as its execution context.
- It binds the execution context when the function is executed by either `call` or `apply`. Both `call` and `apply` set the execution context for a function invocation.
- It binds the execution context when the function is executed using **function call syntax**, eg., `bar()`. A function that is invoked using function call syntax receives the global object as its execution context.

## 14. Implicit and Explicit Execution Context

### 14.1 Execution Context

The execution context -- or **context** -- is a concept that refers to the **environment** in which a function executes. In JavaScript, it most commonly refers to the current value of the `this` keyword. When we talk about the execution context of a function or method call, we're talking about the value of `this` when that code executes. The context depends on *how the function or method was invoked*, not on where the function was defined.

The only factor that determines the context is *how you call the function or method*. In other words, two invocations of the same function or method can have very different contexts depending on how you make those calls.

There are two basic ways to set the context when calling a function or method:

1. **Explicit**: The execution context that you set explicitly.
2. **Implicit**: The execution context that JavaScript sets implicitly when your code doesn't provide an explicit context.

Setting the execution context is also called **binding** `this` or **setting the binding**. A binding is something that ties two things together. In this case, it refers to the fact that a call binds `this` to a specific object when the function or method is called.

It's crucial to understand how the execution context, i.e., the value of `this`, is determined and what it refers to in various scenarios. All JavaScript code executes within a context. The top-level context is the `window` object in browsers and the `global` object in Node. All global methods and objects, such as `parseInt` and `Math`, are properties of `window` or `global`.

### 14.2 Function Execution Context (Implicit)

Every JavaScript function call has an execution context. In other words, the `this` keyword is available to every function in your JavaScript program. Every time you call that function, *JavaScript binds some object to `this`*.

Let's define a function and use `this` within it to see what happens:

```js
function foo() {
  console.log("this refers to: " + this);
}

foo();
// this refers to: [object global]
```

Within a regular function call (e.g., `foo()`), JavaScript sets the binding for `this` to the global object. (Remember: in Node, the global object is called `global`; in a browser, it is `window`.) That means that when you use `this` inside the function, it refers to the global object. If you use `this` to access or modify properties, you will access or modify properties on the global object:

```js
function foo() {
  this.bar = 'bar';
}

foo();
global.bar; // 'bar'
```

That makes sense at some level. Since all function calls have an execution context, and since *a regular function call does not provide an explicit context*, JavaScript supplies an implicit context: the global object. We say that this execution context is **implicit** since the function invocation doesn't supply an explicit alternative.

### 14.4 Strict Mode and Implicit Context

When strict mode is enabled, the implicit `this` is assigned to `undefined` instead of the global object:

```js
"use strict"; // the quotes are required

function foo() {
  console.log("this refers to: " + this);
}

foo(); // this refers to: undefined
```

You may run into strict mode without realizing it. For instance, it shows up in JavaScript classes and in **Coderpad**, the environment we use for assessment interviews.

### 14.5 Method Execution Context (Implicit)

When you call a method that belongs to an object, the execution context inside that method call is the object used to call the method. We call that **method execution context**. Method execution syntax is usually said to provide an implicit context; we're using an explicit object to call the method, but JavaScript is interpreting that object as the implicit context. For this reason, we usually say that *method calls provide an implicit execution context*.

```js
let foo = {
  bar: function() {
    console.log(this);
  }
};

foo.bar(); // `foo` is the implicit execution context for `bar`
// => returns { bar: [Function: bar] }
```

It's easy to see that the execution context inside a method call is the object used to call the method.

Be careful, however. The first-class nature of JavaScript functions has ramifications for the execution context. Remember that the context is determined solely by how you call the function or method. Here, `foo.bar()` is considered a method call since we *call it as a method*; that is, we *use the method call syntax `object.method()`*. Since JavaScript functions are first-class objects, `bar` can be called in other ways that change the context:

```js
let baz = foo.bar;
baz(); // => Object [global] {...}
```

In this code, we assign the `foo.bar` method to the `baz` variable. The `foo.bar` property and the `baz` variable now refer to the same function object. What should `baz()` log then? Since `baz` references a method of the `foo` object, you may think that its execution context must be `foo`. That's wrong though: as we've repeated several times, the execution context is determined entirely by how a function or method is called. Since we're *calling `baz` as a standalone function*, its execution context is the global object, not the `foo` object.

### 14.6 `new` and Implicit Execution Context

Function and method calls *provide an implicit context*. For a function call, the implicit context is the global object; for a method call, it's the object used to call the method.

A constructor call with `new` is a third way to *provide an implicit execution context*. When you call a function with `new`, its implicit context is the new object.

Call        | Where          | Example
------------|----------------|----------------------------
Function    | global object  | `foo()`
Method      | calling object | `obj.foo()`
Constructor | new object     | `let object = new Object()`

### 14.7 Explicit Function and Method Execution Context

*You can provide an explicit context to any function or method*, and it doesn't have to be the global object or the object that contains the method. Instead, you can use any object -- or even `null` -- as the execution context for any function or method. There are two main ways to do that in JavaScript: `call` and `apply`.

### 14.8 Implicit and Explicit Execution Context Summary

All JavaScript functions and methods execute within an execution context, sometimes called its `this` binding. How `this` gets bound depends entirely on how the function is invoked. You can't tell a function's execution context by merely looking at how and where it's defined; *you must examine the invocation itself*. The execution context is determined by *how you invoke a function or method*.

Regular function calls use the global object as their execution context, while method calls use the calling object as their context. You can override this behavior by setting the execution context explicitly with either `call` or `apply`.

The mechanics of context binding is an essential but difficult concept. Most difficulties arise from forgetting that *JavaScript does not use lexical scoping rules to determine the binding*. For instance, if you use `this` inside a method of `obj`, you expect that `this` refers to `obj`. However, that's not always the case. It's important to remember that the rules for `this` are entirely different from the rules for variable scope. While a variable's scope is determined by where you write the code, `this` *depends on how you invoke it*.

## 15. Dealing with Context Loss

Let's discuss how functions and methods can "lose context." We've used quotes since functions don't lose their execution context in reality -- they always have one, but it may not be the context that you expect. If you understand how execution context is determined, you shouldn't be surprised by the value of `this` in any given scenario. That said, how a specific context is arrived at isn't always intuitive. Even when you understand the rules, the context for any given invocation may surprise you.

### 15.1 Problem 1 - Method Copied from Object

When you take a method out of an object and execute it as a function or as a method on another object *the function's context is no longer the original object*. For instance:

```js
let john = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  greetings() {
    console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
  },
};

john.greetings();         // context is john
let foo = john.greetings; // Strips context
foo(); // context is now the global object
```

You could use `foo.call(john)` to restore the original context, but suppose you don't execute the function right away or you need to pass it to another function for execution? By the time `foo` gets called, `john` may be out of scope.

```js
function repeatThreeTimes(func) {
  func(); // can't use func.call(john); john is out of scope --> ReferencError: john is not defined
  func();
  func();
}

function foo() {
  let john = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    greetings: function() {
      console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
    },
  };

  repeatThreeTimes(john.greetings); // Strips context
}

foo();

// => hello, undefined undefined
// => hello, undefined undefined
// => hello, undefined undefined
```

### 15.1.1 Solution 1 - Accept the Context Object as a Second Parameter

One way to solve this problem is to change `repeatThreeTimes` to accept the context object as a second parameter, then pass the context to `repeatThreeTimes` when calling it.

```js
function repeatThreeTimes(func, context) {
  func.call(context);
  func.call(context);
  func.call(context);
}

function foo() {
  let john = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    greetings: function() {
      console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
    },
  };

  repeatThreeTimes(john.greetings, john);
}

foo();

// => hello, John Doe
// => hello, John Doe
// => hello, John Doe
```

Some of JavaScript's built-in methods, such as the Array abstraction methods like `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`, use this technique. Such methods take a callback function as an argument and an optional `thisArg` context object that gets used as the callback's execution context.

However, it's not always possible to pass a context argument to a function or method; you may not even be able to change the function if, say, it belongs to a third-party library. Besides, it's generally not a good idea to pass a lot of arguments to your functions; the more arguments a function can accept, the harder the function is to use.

### 15.1.2 Solution 2 - Hard-bind the Method's Context Using `bind`

Another approach you can use is to hard-bind the method's context using `bind`:

```js
function repeatThreeTimes(func) {
  func();
  func();
  func();
}

function foo() {
  let john = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    greetings: function() {
      console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
    },
  };

  repeatThreeTimes(john.greetings.bind(john));
}

foo();

// => hello, John Doe
// => hello, John Doe
// => hello, John Doe
```

`bind` has one significant advantage: once you bind a context to a function, that *binding is permanent* and does not need to be repeated if it gets called more than once. The disadvantage of `bind` is that it is no longer possible to determine the context by looking at the invocation of the final function.

### 15.2 Problem 2 - Inner/Nested Function Not Using the Surrounding Context

Loss of surrounding context is a common issue when dealing with functions nested within object methods. Here, we'll see how **nested functions** *suffer from context loss*.

Examine the following code:

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    function bar() {
      console.log(this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    }

    bar(); // line 9
  },
};

obj.foo();  // => undefined undefined
```

Function or method's execution context depends solely on how you invoke it, not on how and where it's defined. Here, `bar` is *invoked as a standalone function* on line 9. Thus, its execution context is the global object, not the `obj` object that you may have expected.

### 15.2.1 Solution 1: Preserve Context with a Variable in Outer Scope

Use something like `let self = this` or `let that = this` in the outer function. If you define the `self` or `that` variable -- these names are idiomatic, and not a required name --- in the outer scope, you can use that variable and whatever value it contains inside your nested inner function(s).

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    let self = this; // line 5
    function bar() {
      console.log(self.a + ' ' + self.b);
    }

    bar();
  },
};

obj.foo(); // => hello world
```

In this example, line 5 assigns `this` to the local variable `self`. Since JavaScript uses lexical scoping rules for variables, `bar` can access `self` within its body; that lets us use it instead of `this` to access the correct context object.

### 15.2.2 Solution 2: Call Inner Functions with Explicit Context (`call` or `apply`)

You can also use `call` or `apply` to explicitly provide a context when calling the inner function. For instance:

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    function bar() {
      console.log(this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    }

    bar.call(this);
  },
};

obj.foo(); // => hello world
```

We won't show an example of `apply` since you can always use `call` in its place if you use the spread operator to expand `apply`'s array argument.

### 15.2.3 Solution 3: Use `bind`

A third approach is to call `bind` on the inner function and *get a new function* with its execution context permanently set to the object.

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    let bar = function() {
      console.log(this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    }.bind(this);

    // some code
    bar();

    // some more code
    bar();

    // still more code
  }
};

obj.foo();
// => hello world
// => hello world
```

Note that we're calling `bind` on the function expression here, then assigning the returned function to the `bar` variable. You can also use a function declaration instead of a function expression, but you'll need an extra variable:

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    function bar() {
      console.log(this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    }

    let qux = bar.bind(this);

    // some code
    qux();

    // some more code
    qux();

    // still more code
  }
};

obj.foo();
// => hello world
// => hello world
```

One advantage of `bind` is that you can do it once and then *call it as often as needed without an explicit context*.

### 15.2.4 Solution 4: Using an Arrow Function

Arrow functions inherit their execution context from the surrounding context. That means that an arrow function *defined inside another function* always has the same context as the outer function's context:

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    let bar = () => {
      console.log(this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    }

    // some code
    bar();

    // some more code
    bar();

    // still more code
  }
};

obj.foo();
// => hello world
// => hello world
```

Using arrow functions like this is similar to using `bind` in that you don't have to worry about arrow functions losing their surrounding context. An arrow function, once created, *always has the same context as the function that surrounded it when it was created*. Using arrow functions is the most common these days.

### 15.3 Don't Use Arrow Functions as Methods on an Object

Despite how useful arrow functions are for avoiding context loss, *you should not try to use them as methods on an object*. They don't work as expected.

```js
let obj = {
  a: 5,

  foo: () => {
    console.log(this.a);
  },
};

obj.foo(); // line 9 => undefined
```

Arrow functions always get the value of `this` from the surrounding context. In the code shown above, it certainly looks like the surrounding context is `obj`, so shouldn't `this` refer to `obj`? Despite appearances and what your logic tells you, that isn't the case.

The surrounding context is, in fact, the `global object`. The reason for that is simple: the `let` statement in this example *is in the program's top-level code*, so its context is the global object. That means that `this` inside the object literal is also the global object, so `this` on line 5 refers to the global object, not `obj`.

When using `node` to execute a file, e.g., `node somefile.js`, the surrounding context is the `module`, not the global object. This can cause a certain amount of confusion when working with node in both REPL and file modes.

You may have noticed that `this` in `obj.foo` is not determined by how the method is called. We call the method on line 9, and we seem to be telling JavaScript to use `obj` as the context. Instead, the context ends up being the global object. That seems to contradict our repeated statements that the context is determined entirely by how a function or method is invoked. That's clearly not the case here; it certainly violates the rule. However, *you won't usually see code like this in practice.*

In general, you should not use arrow functions to write methods. According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), "Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors." The example shown here demonstrates one reason why that is so: it doesn't follow the rules. As long as you don't try to use arrow functions as methods, you can ignore this exception.

### 15.4 Problem 3 - Function as Argument Losing Surrounding Context

In this assignment, we'll see how *passing functions as arguments can strip them of their intended context objects*, and see what we can do to deal with that loss. This scenario is a variation of one that we dealt with in the previous assignment. Examine this code:

```js
function repeatThreeTimes(func) {
  func();
  func();
  func();
}

let john = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  greetings: function() {
    repeatThreeTimes(function() {
      console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
    });
  },
};

john.greetings();

// => hello, undefined undefined
// => hello, undefined undefined
// => hello, undefined undefined
```

In this example, we use the `john` object to call the `greetings` method, with `john` as its context. `greetings`, in turn, calls the `repeatThreeTimes` function with a function argument whose body refers to `this`. `repeatThreeTimes` *calls its argument three times with an implicit context*. As we've learned, the context is determined by how a function is invoked, so the context for all three invocations will be the global object. Thus, `this` inside the function passed to `repeatThreeTimes` is the **global object**, not `john`.

You might look at this and think that this problem probably doesn't happen often. However, consider the following code:

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    [1, 2, 3].forEach(function(number) {
      console.log(String(number) + ' ' + this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    });
  },
};

obj.foo();

// => 1 undefined undefined
// => 2 undefined undefined
// => 3 undefined undefined
```

That code looks simple enough; it loops over an array and logs some information to the console. The problem, though, is that `forEach` executes the function expression passed to it, so it *gets executed with the global object as context*. Once again, this has the wrong value, and the function doesn't do what we want.

This problem is easy to fix. You can use the same solutions we used to solve a similar problem in the previous assignment.

### 15.4.1 Solution 1: Preserve the Context with a Variable in Outer Scope

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    let self = this;
    [1, 2, 3].forEach(function(number) {
      console.log(String(number) + ' ' + self.a + ' ' + self.b);
    });
  },
};

obj.foo();

// => 1 hello world
// => 2 hello world
// => 3 hello world
```

### 15.4.2 Solution 2: Use `bind`

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    [1, 2, 3].forEach(function(number) {
      console.log(String(number) + ' ' + this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    }.bind(this));
  },
};

obj.foo();

// => 1 hello world
// => 2 hello world
// => 3 hello world
```

### 15.4.3 Solution 3: Use an Arrow Function

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    [1, 2, 3].forEach(number => {
      console.log(String(number) + ' ' + this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    });
  },
};

obj.foo();

// => 1 hello world
// => 2 hello world
// => 3 hello world
```

### 15.4.4 Solution 4: Use the optional `thisArg` argument

Some methods that take function arguments allow an optional argument that specifies the context to use when invoking the function. `Array.prototype.forEach`, for instance, has an optional `thisArg` argument for the context. This argument makes it easy to work around this context-loss problem. The array methods `map`, `every` and `some` and others also take an optional `thisArg` argument.

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    [1, 2, 3].forEach(function(number) {
      console.log(String(number) + ' ' + this.a + ' ' + this.b);
    }, this);
  },
};

obj.foo();

// => 1 hello world
// => 2 hello world
// => 3 hello world
```

### 15.5 Dealing with Context Loss Summary

Passing a function as an argument to another function *strips it of its execution context*, which means *the function argument gets invoked with the context set to the global object*. This problem is identical to the problem with copying a method from an object and using it as a bare function. For instance, the following two code snippets do the same thing:

```js
// Snippet 1
array.forEach(obj.logData);

// Snippet 2
let logData = obj.logData;
array.forEach(logData);
```

In both snippets, the `obj.logData` method gets invoked by `forEach` with the global object as the context, not `obj`.

## 16. `call`, `apply`, and `bind`

The `call` and `apply` methods *invoke a function with an explicit execution context*.  To pass arguments to a function with `call`, the arguments should be specified as separate arguments.

The `bind` method *returns a new function that permanently binds a function to a context*.

Arrow functions are permanently bound to the execution context of the enclosing function invocation. When defined at the top level, the context of an arrow function is the global object.

### 16.1 Explicit Execution Context with `call`

The `call` method calls a function with an explicit execution context.

```js
function logNum() {
  console.log(this.num);
}

let obj = {
  num: 42
};

logNum.call(obj); // logs 42
```

We can call the `logNum` function and tell it to use `obj` as its execution context. When we use `call` in this manner, `this` refers to the `obj` object inside the `logNum` function. The first argument to `call` *provides the explicit context for the function invocation*. The context doesn't get determined until we invoke the function; in this case, we're using `call` to invoke it and set the context.

The code is functionally similar to the following:

```js
function logNum() {
  console.log(this.num);
}

let obj = {
  num: 42
};

obj.logNum = logNum;
obj.logNum(); // logs 42
```

Those last two code examples aren't identical, however. In the second example, we add a new property to the `obj` object; *we don't mutate the object when we use `call`.*

You can also use `call` to explicitly set execution context on methods, not just functions:

```js
let obj1 = {
  logNum() {
    console.log(this.num);
  }
};

let obj2 = {
  num: 42
};

obj1.logNum.call(obj2); // logs 42
```

The behavior here is similar to:

```js
let obj1 = {
  logNum() {
    console.log(this.num);
  }
};

let obj2 = {
  num: 42
};

obj2.logNum = obj1.logNum;
obj2.logNum(); // logs 42

// We mutate `obj2` when we give it a `logNum` property that it didn't have before.
console.log(obj2) // => { num: 42, logNum: [ Function: logNum]}
```

Again, there is a difference: in this case, we *mutate* `obj2` when we give it a `logNum` property that it didn't have before.

You may have already spotted a problem with this pattern. Suppose our function takes arguments. How do we provide them? Let's see an example to illustrate this point:

```js
function sumNum(num1) {
  return this.num + num1;
}

let obj = {
  num: 42
};
```

We want to call `sumNum` in such a way that it updates `obj.num`. Fortunately, the `call` method *lets us pass arguments as a comma-separated list to our function*:

```js
obj.num = sumNum.call(obj, 5);
console.log(obj.num); // => 47
```

Again, we can understand this better if we try to write the code more directly:

```js
function sumNum(num1) {
  return this.num + num1;
}

let obj = {
  num: 42
};

obj.sumNum = sumNum;
obj.num = obj.sumNum(5);
console.log(obj.num); // => 47
```

You can, of course, add as many arguments to the `call` method invocation as the function needs. Let's see another, more complex example:

```js
let iPad = {
  name: 'iPad',
  price: 40000,
};

let kindle = {
  name: 'Kindle',
  price: 30000,
};

function printLine(lineNumber, punctuation) {
  console.log(`${lineNumber}: ${this.name}, ${this.price / 100} dollars${punctuation}`);
}

printLine.call(iPad, 1, ';');        // => 1: iPad, 400 dollars;
printLine.call(kindle, 2, '.');      // => 2: Kindle, 300 dollars.
```

The general syntax for `call` is as follows:

```js
someObject.someMethod.call(context, arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)
```

### 16.2 Explicit Execution Context with `apply`

The apply method works in much the same way as call. The only difference is that *apply uses an array* to pass any arguments to the function. Here's the general syntax:

```js
someObject.someMethod.apply(context, [arg1, arg2, arg3, ...])
```

`apply` is handy when you have the list of arguments in an array. With modern JavaScript (ES6 and higher), `apply` isn't needed since *you can use `call` in conjunction with the spread operator to accomplish the same thing*:

```js
let args = [arg1, arg2, arg3];
someObject.someMethod.call(context, ...args);
```

### 16.3 Hard Binding Functions with Contexts - `bind`

In the previous two assignments, we learned about two methods on function objects that we *can use to set the execution context of function and method calls explicitly*: `call` and `apply`. JavaScript has a third way to specify the context: the `bind` method on function objects. `bind` works a little differently, however. Let's see an example:

```js
function sumNum(num1) {
  return this.num + num1;
}

let obj = {
  num: 42
};

let sumNum2 = sumNum.bind(obj);
sumNum2(5); // => 47
```

In this example, we don't call the function immediately as we do when using `call` and `apply`, Instead, *bind returns a new function*. The new function is **permanently** bound to the object passed as bind's first argument. You can then pass that method around and call it without worrying about losing its context since it's *permanently bound* to the provided object.

Let's see another example:

```js
let object = {
  a: 'hello',
  b: 'world',
  foo: function() {
    return this.a + ' ' + this.b;
  },
};

let bar = object.foo;
bar();  // "undefined undefined"

let baz = object.foo.bind(object);
baz(); // "hello world"
```

An interesting and important property of permanently bound functions is that *you cannot change their execution context*, even if you use `call` or `apply` or call `bind` a second time. Continuing with the code from the previous example:

```js
let object2 = {
  a: 'hi',
  b: 'there',
};

baz.call(object2);  // "hello world" - `this` still refers to `object` from the previous code snippet
```

JavaScript implements the `bind` method something like this:

```js
Function.prototype.bind = function (...args) {
  let fn = this;
  let context = args.shift();

  return function () {
    return fn.apply(context, args);
  };
};
```

`bind`'s context is the original function, and it *returns a new function that calls the original function with the context supplied to `bind` as its first argument*. This code also shows why *the binding makes permanent changes* -- no matter what you do to the returned function, you can't change the value of `context`.

A trap that students often fall into is the thinking that `bind` permanently alters the original function. It's important to remember that `bind` *returns a new function*, and that new function is permanently context-bound to the object provided as the first argument to `bind`. The original function isn't changed and doesn't have its context changed.

It's also important to understand that `bind` does not contradict our repeated statement that context is determined entirely based on how you call a function or method, not where you call it or how you define it. Technically, `bind` defines a new function. However, when we call that function, its implementation -- as shown above -- calls the original function using `apply`. Thus, it's still the "how" of the call that determines the context, not the definition or location.

Let's close this assignment with a final example:

```js
let greetings = {
  morning: 'Good morning, ',
  afternoon: 'Good afternoon, ',
  evening: 'Good evening, ',

  greeting: function(name) {
    let currentHour = (new Date()).getHours();

    if (currentHour < 12) {
      console.log(this.morning + name);
    } else if (currentHour < 18) {
      console.log(this.afternoon + name);
    } else {
      console.log(this.evening + name);
    }
  }
};

let spanishWords = {
  morning: 'Buenos dias, ',
  afternoon: 'Buenas tardes, ',
  evening: 'Buena noches, '
};

let spanishGreeter = greetings.greeting.bind(spanishWords);

spanishGreeter('Jose');
spanishGreeter('Juan');
```

In this example, we bind the `greeting` function to the `spanishWords` object and assign the result to `spanishGreeter`. When we call `spanishGreeter`, JavaScript uses `spanishWords` as the context. Thus, `spanishGreeter('Jose')` will log something like `'Buenas tardes, Jose'` instead of `'Good afternoon, Jose'`.

In this assignment, we saw a third way to specify the execution context. Unlike `call` and `apply`, though, `bind` *returns a new function that is permanently bound to the context that's provided to bind as the first argument*. You cannot alter the execution context of the resulting function, even if you use `call`, `apply`, or try calling `bind` a second time.

## 17. `Object.assign` and `Object.create`

### 17.1 `Object.assign(target, ...sources)` - Mixin

Static object method which copies the properties and methods of one object to another. It does not work with classes or functions, only with an object instance.

- **copies** all enumerable own properties from one or more `source` objects to a `target` object. It returns the modified target object.
- Properties in the target object are overwritten by properties in the sources if they have the same key. Later sources' properties overwrite earlier ones.
- The `Object.assign()` method only copies ***enumerable* and *own*** properties from a source object to a target object. It uses `[[Get]]` on the source and `[[Set]]` on the target, so it will invoke getters/setters, and therefore it ***assigns*** properties.
- **Parameters**
  - `target` the target object — what to apply the sources’ properties to, which is returned after it is modified.
  - `sources` the source object(s) — objects containing the properties you want to apply.

```js
// Object.assign() takes a target and applies a variable number of sources to it.
// EX: Object.assign(target, ...sources) => returns modified target

let source = {
  src: 'Source Property',
}

let target = {};
Object.assign(target, source);
target.trg = "Target Property";

console.log(target);  // => { src: 'Source Property', trg: 'Target Property' }
console.log(source);  // => { src: 'Source Property' }

// Changing the source property after assignment does not matter for primitive types

source.src = "Something Different";

console.log(target);  // => { src: 'Source Property', trg: 'Target Property' }
console.log(source);  // => { src: 'Something Different' }

// Object.assign overwrites similar property names with the source's value

source.src = ['Value']
Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target);  // => { src: [ 'Value' ], trg: 'Target Property' }
console.log(source);  // => { src: [ 'Value' ] }

// Assign uses shallow copies, so references in the target still point to the source
// Updating a non-primitive in the source will affect the target

source.src[0] = "Something Different";

console.log(target);  // => { src: [ 'Something Different' ], trg: 'Target Property' }
console.log(source);  // => { src: [ 'Something Different' ] }

// Assign only copies the values/references to the object. Source is not a prototype.
console.log(target.__proto__ === source); // => false
```

Considerations with Object.assign():

- `target` is both mutated and returned.
- For any key on `target`, the latest source will overwrite the value.
- Only copies *own properties* for both `target` and `source`.
- If value is a reference, only a copy of reference is provided (Use Stringify to get deep copy).
- Does not leverage prototyping for memory efficiency and typing.

#### 17.1.1 Uses of `Object.assign()`

One object factory can *reuse another object* factory by mixing the object returned by another factory function into itself by using `Object.assign()`.

The mixin pattern involves creating a mixin object containing certain methods, and using `Object.assign()` to mix that object into another object.

### 17.2 `Object.create(proto, [propertiesObject])` - Inheritance

- Returns a **new object**, using an *existing object* as the **prototype** of the newly created object.
- **Parameters**
  - `proto` - the object which is the prototype of the newly-created object (i.e. the newly created object will inherit from this)
  - `[propertiesObject]` - If specified and not `undefined`, an object whose enumerable **own** properties (that is, those properties defined upon itself and *not* enumerable properties along its prototype chain) specify property descriptors to be added to the newly-created object, with the corresponding property names. These properties correspond to the second argument of `Object.defineProperties()`
- **Exceptions**
  - `proto` - must be either an Object (excluding primitive wrapper objects), or `null` - otherwise a `TypeError` is thrown.

## 18. Built-in Constructors like `Array`, `Object`, `String` and `Number`

JavaScript comes with a variety of built-in constructors and prototypes that let you *instantiate useful objects*. These constructors work like constructors for other objects; they're used with the `new` keyword to create objects. In this assignment, we will discuss some of JavaScript's built-in constructors, their prototypes, and how you can extend them.

### 18.1 The `Array` constructor

You've seen and worked with array objects many times so far. The simplest way to create an array object uses the bracket syntax:

```sh
> let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
> numbers
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

This syntax is how you usually create arrays in JavaScript. However, you can also use the `Array` constructor:

```sh
> let emptyArray = new Array();
> emptyArray
[]
```

As you might suspect, calling `new Array()` creates and returns a new array. That array is empty unless you also pass some arguments to the constructor. Each argument you provide gets added to the new array as an element:

```sh
> let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4)
> numbers
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

> let colors = new Array('green', 'blue', 'yellow')
> colors
[ 'green', 'blue', 'yellow' ]
```

The behavior is considerably different when you *provide a single number argument*. In this case, *the constructor creates an array with a length equal to the number specified by the argument*, but with no actual elements:

```sh
> new Array(3)
[ <3 empty items> ]
```

You can think of `[ <3 empty items> ]` as an array that has three empty slots. In effect, it's an empty array that happens to contain spaces for three items; alternatively, it's a non-empty array that contains no values. Call it Schrödinger's array if you wish.

Note that the single-number form of the constructor *does not accept non-integers or negative numbers*:

```sh
> new Array(3.1415)
=> RangeError: Invalid array length

> new Array(-5)
=> RangeError: Invalid array length
```

The single-number constructor, together with the `Array.prototype.fill` method, lets you create arrays with a value that is repeated in every element:

```sh
> (new Array(3)).fill('*');
[ '*', '*', '*' ]
```

The `fill` method takes any value as an argument and replaces all elements of the array with that value. Note that the parentheses around `new Array(3)` aren't strictly necessary; however, you should *use them for clarity*. They show your intent to run `fill` on the new array.

You may recall that the `new` keyword provides some useful behavior when creating new objects. In many cases, omitting the keyword can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. Interestingly, `Array` *lets you omit the new keyword*:

```sh
> Array(1, 2, 3)
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
```

The behavior of this above code is identical to the earlier example that uses `new Array(1, 2, 3)`.

Some other JavaScript constructors exhibit this behavior. In fact, the ECMAScript specification document requires it in specific cases. However, that doesn't mean that you should omit `new` routinely in your code. You might be using a constructor that doesn't implement this behavior, which can sometimes lead to different behavior when you omit `new`.

For now, don't worry about why the specification requires this behavior or how you can do the same thing yourself. *Stay consistent and use `new` unless there's a good reason to omit it*.

### 18.1.1 Lesson 3 Quiz 1 Question 5

Examine the following code.

```js
let arr1 = new Array(1, 2, 3);
let arr2 = Array(1, 2, 3);

console.log(arr1 === arr2); // line 4 => false
```

While line 4 shows that the two arrays are different objects, it doesn't reveal whether the two arrays differ in any other way, i.e., in their type, content, or behavior. Do the arrays differ in any way other than being separate objects?

Both arrays are identical: they are both objects of type Array, and they both have the same values in their elements. JavaScript does not require the `new` keyword when creating arrays; the `Array` constructor works the same regardless of whether `new` is used.

#### 18.1.2 `Array.prototype` (Instance Methods)

As with any JavaScript function, the `Array` constructor has a `prototype` property. All arrays inherit from the object referenced by this property:

```sh
> let numbers = [1, 2, 3]
> Object.getPrototypeOf(numbers) === Array.prototype
true
```

This relationship implies that *every array can use the methods defined in `Array.prototype`.* In particular, that means that all arrays can use methods like `forEach`, `map`, `includes`, as well as all the other methods defined on `Array.prototype`:

```js
// let numbers = [1, 2, 3] <-- from above
> numbers.map(number => number * number);
[ 1, 4, 9 ]

> numbers.includes(3)
true
```

If you go to the [MDN documentation page for arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), you'll see a list of all these array methods with names that follow the pattern `Array.prototype.aMethod`. These methods are the **instance methods** for the Array type.

#### 18.1.3 Static Array Methods

Besides instance methods, the array type also has several static methods. We'll discuss two in this section. Remember: *static methods belong directly to the constructor function*; they aren't part of the prototype used to create new objects. As a result, their names don't include `.prototype`. Moreover, you usually use the constructor to invoke the static methods, not the object created by that constructor. (This definition isn't complete, but it will do for our purposes.)

**Array.isArray**

The `Array.isArray` static method helps distinguish between arrays and objects. The `typeof` operator returns `object` when used with an array, so cannot be used to detect an array. `Array.isArray` helps improves readability and show intent.

The `Array.isArray` method takes one argument and returns `true` if the argument is an array object, and `false` if it is not:

```sh
> Array.isArray([])
true

> Array.isArray({})
false

> Array.isArray(5)
false
```

Programs often use `Array.isArray` to verify or refute that a given value is an array object.  The `typeof` operator returns an unexpected and somewhat useless value when used with an array:

```sh
> typeof []
'object'
```

We need `Array.isArray` to distinguish between arrays and other objects.

**Array.from**

The `Array.from` method takes an **array-like object** as an argument and returns a new array with the equivalent element values. *An array-like object is any object that has a `length` property* and provides indexed access to some of its properties with the `[index]` notation. Such objects have properties whose keys are non-negative integers. In many cases, the `length` property won't self-update if you add or remove properties to or from the object.

```sh
> Array.from({0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c', length: 3})
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

The following code shows one way to implement the logic behind `Array.from`. Studying this code should help you make sense of what `Array.from` does:

```js
let arrayFrom = obj => {
  let len = obj.length;
  let returnArr = [];

  for (let idx = 0; idx < len; idx += 1) {
    returnArr.push(obj[idx]);
  }

  return returnArr;
};

arrayFrom({0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c', length: 3});
// => [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
```

Why would somebody need to do that? It seems silly to create an object that looks like an array but isn't an array. Why bother?

The use case shown isn't particularly useful, but there are other use cases for `Array.from`. In particular, some functions and methods return objects that resemble arrays in some ways but serve some other purpose. For instance, if you use JavaScript to request a list of elements from your browser, the **DOM** (more on that much later) may return an array-like object called a **node list**. Such objects can *store live data* -- dynamic data that can change without intervention by your code. A simple array wouldn't do the trick here, but a node list does. Better yet, the node list is an array-like object, so `Array.from` can create an array based on its content.

In the degenerate case, all arrays are themselves array-like objects.

### 18.2 The `Object` constructor

As with the `Array` constructor, the `Object` constructor creates new objects:

```sh
> new Object()
{}
```

You can invoke `Object` without the `new` keyword, just as you can omit `new` with the `Array` constructor:

```sh
> Object()
{}
```

To repeat ourselves, omitting `new` is probably not a good practice.

#### 18.2.1 `Object.prototype`

All objects created by the `Object` constructor or with object literal syntax (e.g., `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`, inherit from `Object.prototype`. Thus, all such objects have access to the instance methods defined in `Object.prototype`. We've already seen some of these methods in action, such as `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` and `Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf`.

Since arrays are a subtype of objects, it should come as no surprise that *all array objects have access to all the methods* on `Object.prototype`.

```sh
> ['a', 'b', 'c'].hasOwnProperty(1)
true
```

You can think of the integer indices as properties of the array. In our example, `0`, `1`, `2` are the properties and `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'` are the values. We can verify that `Array` is a subtype of `Object` by checking whether `Array.prototype` inherits from `Object.prototype`:

```sh
> Object.getPrototypeOf(Array.prototype) === Object.prototype
true
```

**Almost all JavaScript objects, whether built-in or custom-created, inherit from `Object.prototype`, either directly or further down the prototype chain.** That includes prototype objects of constructors. Note that we said "almost all"; as discussed in an earlier lesson, it is possible to create objects that don't inherit from `Object.prototype`.

Another oft-used method is `Object.prototype.toString`. It returns a string representation of the object that it's called on. Since `toString` is a method on `Object.prototype`, all JavaScript objects -- including arrays, functions, and dates -- inherit this method. However, the default behavior of `Object.prototype.toString` is not very useful; it merely returns `[object Object]` for objects that don't override this method to provide smarter behavior:

```sh
> let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }
> obj.toString()
'[object Object]'   // not very helpful!

> [1, 2, 3].toString()
'1,2,3'

> let func = function hello() {}
> func.toString()
'function hello() {}'
```

#### 18.2.2 Static `Object` Methods

The list below shows some commonly used static `Object` methods. You've already seen and used several. Feel free to follow the links and read more about these methods, but you don't have to memorize them. Instead, learn what's available. You can look them up later when you need to use them:

- `Object.assign()`
- `Object.create()`
- `Object.entries()`
- `Object.freeze()`
- `Object.isFrozen()`
- `Object.keys()`
- `Object.values()`

### 18.3 The Date Constructor

The Date constructor creates objects, commonly called a **date object**, that represent a specific date and time. Calling `Date` without arguments returns a date object that represents the creation date and time of the object:

```sh
> let now = new Date()
> now
2022-03-09T14:57:44.473Z
```

You can create date objects that represent any given date and time by passing additional arguments to the Date constructor. For instance, to create a date object that represents "May 1, 1983", you can write:

```sh
> let birthday = new Date("May 1, 1983")
> birthday
1983-05-01T07:00:00.000Z
```

You can get even more specific by including the time:

```sh
> birthday = new Date("May 1, 1983 05:03 am")
> birthday
1983-05-01T12:03.00.000Z
```

The dates shown by the above code may appear as 1983-05-02. This issue is caused by the time zone of the environment where you run the code. Working with time zones is messy; we won't get into that in this course.

There are several other ways to specify the date and time, including variations on the date strings shown above, and by providing other arguments to the `Date` constructor. Check the [MDN documentation for Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) to learn more.

#### 18.3.1 Date.prototype

The `Date` prototype object provides a variety of convenient methods for working with dates. We'll mention a few here.

**`Date.prototype.toString()`**

The `toString` method returns a string that represents the date (it's pretty verbose):

```sh
> let now = new Date()
undefined
> now.toString()
'Wed Mar 09 2022 15:07:09 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)'
>
```

**`Date.prototype.getFullYear()`**

The `getFullYear` method returns the year from the date as a number:

```sh
> now.getFullYear()
2022
```

**`Date.prototype.getDay()`**

The `getDay` method returns a number that represents the day of the week that corresponds to the date object. The return value is `0` for Sunday, `1` for Monday, and so on until it returns `6` for Saturday.

```sh
> now.getDay()
3 // (represents Wednesday)
```

The `Date` prototype has a bunch of useful methods for working with dates and times. Be sure to check the [MDN documentation page for Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) and explore a few more methods.

### 18.4 The `String` Constructor

Why do we need a constructor for strings? Aren't JavaScript strings a primitive type? We know they are since the strict equality operator compares strings by value rather than identity:

```sh
> 'abc' === 'abc'
true
```

Two strings with the same characters are considered equal in JavaScript. Equality for objects works by identity, however. Two objects are strictly equal only when they are the same object. Consider:

```js
> let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
> let arr2 = arr1    // arr1 and arr2 both reference the same object
> arr1 === [1, 2, 3] // false
> arr1 === arr2      // true
```

Interestingly, we can *access properties and call methods on strings*:

```js
> 'abc'.length
3

> 'abc'.toUpperCase()
'ABC'
```

How is that possible given that strings are primitive values? Primitive values aren't objects, so where does JavaScript find those properties and methods?

We'll return to those questions shortly. First, though, we need to learn that JavaScript has two kinds of strings: **string primitives** and **`String` objects**. Thus far, all the strings we've created and used have been string primitives. We create string primitives by using quotes (single or double) or back-tick characters to define a string's value. To create a `String` object, on the other hand, we must use the `String` constructor:

```sh
> let strPrimitive = 'abc'
> typeof strPrimitive
'string'

> let strObject = new String('xyz')
> typeof strObject
'object'
```

That's interesting: a string primitive's type is `'string'`, but the `String` object's type is `'object'`. It's clear that JavaScript considers the two types of string as different types. That difference has implications. Consider this code:

```sh
> 'abc' === 'abc'
true

> new String('abc') === new String('abc')
false
```

Wow! Two string primitives that have the same value are equal, but not two `String` objects. If you're confused by that, think of poor JavaScript. What's an OOP language to do with weirdness like that? Fortunately, JavaScript is pretty good about remembering what's what.

That still leaves us with a big question: why in the world do we need a `String` object? That goes back to our original question: how can we call methods on string primitives?

The answer is that when you try to access a property or invoke a method on a string primitive, JavaScript *wraps* the string primitive in a `String` object behind the scenes. The process sounds complicated and costly in computing resources, but the implementation is reasonably lightweight; there is little impact on your program. Best of all, the process is invisible.

Once JavaScript has wrapped your string primitive in a `String` object, it then uses the object to access the property or call the method. When the wrapping object has served its purpose, JavaScript discards it.

If a property or method returns a string, it returns a string primitive, so you also don't have to worry about converting `String` objects to primitives.

As a general rule, *you should not create* `String` objects explicitly. That's where you're likely to run into problems with the distinction between string primitives and `String` objects. However, if you're writing code where you may have to operate on `String` objects, you can use `String.prototype.valueOf()` to retrieve the value of the `String` object as a primitive.

#### 18.4.1 `String` Without `new`

As with most constructors, with the notable exception of `Array` and `Object`, calling the constructor without the `new` keyword *does not create* an object. In the case of `String`, it simply returns a new string, not an object, when you omit the `new` keyword:

```sh
> let str = String('abc')
> typeof str
'string'

# with `new` keyword
> let str = new String('abc')
> typeof str
'object'
>
```

The `String` function takes non-string values as arguments as well. In that case, it *converts the value to a string*:

```sh
> String(undefined)
'undefined'

> String(3.14)
'3.14'

> String([1, 2, 3])
'1,2,3'

> String(a => a * a)
'a => a * a'
```

#### 18.4.2 Lesson 3 Quiz 1 Question 6

Examine the following code.

```js
let str1 = new String("abc");
let str2 = String("abc");

console.log(str1 === str2); // => false
```

While line 4 shows that the two strings are not identical, it doesn't reveal how the strings differ. Do the strings differ in any other way?

Yes. `str1` is an object of type `String`, while `str2` is a string primitive. Functionally, the two values act like objects in that you can write `str1.toLowerCase()` or `str2.toLowerCase()`. That's because *JavaScript silently wraps string primitives in a String class when it needs to use a method or property.* In addition, `typeof str1` returns `object`, while `typeof str2` returns `string`.

### 18.5 The `Number` and `Boolean` Constructors

The `Number` and `Boolean` constructors work in much the same way as the `String` constructor. When called with `new`, they create `Number` and `Boolean` objects. When called without `new`, the `Number` function *converts its argument to a number*, and the `Boolean` function *converts its argument to a boolean*.

```sh
> Number('123');
123

> Boolean(0);
false

> Boolean('abc');
true
```

As with strings, numbers and booleans both have primitive and object forms, and JavaScript invisibly wraps primitives in objects to access methods and properties. You should also *avoid creating `Number` and `Boolean` objects explicitly*.

### 18.6 Extending Built-in Prototypes

Since all JavaScript objects derive their behavior from the prototype objects associated with their constructors, we can add new capabilities to our built-in objects by changing those prototypes. For example, we can add a `first` method to all arrays by adding it to `Array.prototype`:

```js
Array.prototype.first = function() {
  return this[0];
}

[1, 2, 3].first(); // => 1
```

Since we use the array `[1, 2, 3]` to call `first`, `this` inside the function refers to `[1, 2, 3]`. Thus, the `first` method returns the first element of the array used to call it, or `undefined` if the array is empty.

Extending built-in objects is interesting to study, but it's *best to avoid doing so*. Adding a method like `first` to an array object *can confuse other developers* working on your project. It can lead to errors when other developers forget or don't realize that your array has an unexpected bonus.

### 18.7 Borrowing Array Methods for Strings

First-class functions in a programming language provide several benefits. One significant benefit is that methods aren't tied to a particular object type. *Using explicit context-binding techniques*, we can apply a method to a different object type than the one that defines the method. This "method borrowing," however, doesn't make sense for every object and every method. For example, it doesn't make sense to use the `getDay` date method on an array.

Array methods, however, are surprisingly useful with `String` objects. We can borrow many array methods to manipulate String objects. Consider the following code:

```js
let string = 'EEE';
Array.prototype.every.call(string, char => char === 'E'); // => true
```

JavaScript strings don't have an `every` method, but we can use `Array.prototype.every` on our string by using `call` or `apply`. Here, we use `every` to determine whether the string `EEE` contains all `E` characters.

We can shorten that expression noticeably by using an empty array instead of `Array.prototype` as the calling object:

```js
[].every.call(string, char => char === 'E'); // => true
```

Why does method borrowing work? Let's look at a simplified implementation of `Array.prototype.every`:

```js
Array.prototype.every = function(callback) {
  for (let index = 0; index < this.length; index++) {
    if (!callback(this[index])) return false;
  }

  return true;
};
```

Note how the method uses `this` to access the length and elements of the array that called it. Since `String` objects also have a `length` property and use index-based element access, this code works with strings as well as arrays.

Let's see another example:

```js
[].filter.call('olives', val => val < 'm'); // [ 'l', 'i', 'e' ]
```

Notice that the `filter` method *returns an array, even though we called it on a string*. If you think about it, that makes sense. The `call` and `apply` functions don't change a function's logic or return values; they merely change what object the method uses for its context. Array methods that return an array will still do so even when called on a string value. If you need a string result, you can use `join` to convert the array to a string:

```js
[].filter.call('olives', val => val < 'm').join(''); // => 'lie'
```

Note that not all array methods can operate on strings. Consider the following example:

```js
let ingredients = 'olives';
[].push.call(ingredients, ' and pepper');
// TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'length' of object '[object String]'
```

*Array methods that mutate the array won't work with strings*. Again, that makes sense: strings are **immutable**.
