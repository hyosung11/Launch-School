/* JavaScript Constructors and Prototypes by Toby Ho https://tobyho.com/2010/11/22/javascript-constructors-and/

JavaScript functions double as object constructors.

To simulate a class in OOP, you write: */

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

/* use the `new` statement/keyword to create a `Person` */
let sohee = new Person('Sohee');
// console.log(sohee); // Person { name: 'Sohee' }

// check that `sohee` is a `Person`
// console.log(sohee instanceof Person); // true

// could call `Person` as a function without `new`
// console.log(Person('Sohee')); // undefined

/* don't do this because you create a `name` global variable */
// console.log(name) // Sohee

/* If there was already a variable called `name`, it would have been overwritten. When you call a function as a function without `new`, `this` is set to the global object - in the browser, this is the `window` object: */

// window.name // 'Sohee'

// this === window // true

/* If you want to write a constructor, use it like a constructor, if you want to write a function, use it like a function, don't mix and match.

Here's a way to prevent this polluting of the namespace (preventing the creation of global variables) */

function Person(name) {
  if (!(this instanceof Person))
    return new Person(name);
  this.name = name;
}

/* What this does is:

1. Check whether this is really a Person - which it would be if called using new.
2. If it indeed is a Person, go on your merry way.
3. If it is not a Person, use a new to create a Person - the correct way, and return it.

This allows calling it as a function to return a Person, and it doesnâ€™t pollute the namespace. */

// console.log(Person('Sohee')); // Person { name: 'Sohee' }
// console.log(name); // ReferenceError: name is not defined

/* calling with `new` still works too */
// console.log(new Person('Sohee')); // Person { name: 'Sohee' }

/* Why? It turns out if you return a value in a `constructor`, JavaScript will honor it, and return it as a newly created object when you use `new`. But, you might be thinking, can I return a non-`Person`? */

function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

function Person(name) {
  return new Cat(name);
}

let omi = new Person('Omi');
// console.log(omi instanceof Person); // false
// console.log(omi instanceof Cat); // true

/* So, I ask for a `Person` and I get a `Cat`? Well, in JS it can happen. You can even return an `Array`. */

function Person(name) {
  return [name];
}

// console.log(new Person('SungOh')); // [ 'SungOh' ]

/* But you cannot return a primitive type. Number, String, Boolean, are all primitive types. If you return one of these types of values from a constructor, it would be ignored and the constructor would go back to its normal behavior of returning the `this` object. */

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  return 6
}

// console.log(new Person('SungOh')); // returns the `this` object [ 'SungOh' ]

/* METHODS

Functions double as constructors
Functions triple as they also act as methods */
