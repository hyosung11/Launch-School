/* Lesson 1 Quiz 1

Question 1

Which of the following statements accurately describes OOP? Choose all the answers that apply.

Your Answer: B and E

A. An acronym that stands for Object-Oriented Paradigm

B. A programming paradigm in which we think about a problem in terms of objects.

C. A programming paradigm in which we think about problems as a series of steps.

D. A programming paradigm designed by academics for academics, but has no real-world applications.

E. A style of programming that uses objects that interact with each other.

F. None of the above choices properly describe OOP.

Discussion

Incorrect:

A: OOP is an acronym that stands for Object-Oriented Programming, not Object Oriented Paradigm.

C: Thinking about problems as a series of steps is procedural programming, not OOP.

D: While this may have been true for a brief period early in OOP's long history, it is most definitely not an academic paradigm intended for academics. Most real-world applications today use OOP in some manner.

F: Both B and E are appropriate ways to describe OOP.

Question 2

Which of the following are benefits of using OOP? Select all that apply.

Your Answer: A and C

A. Large, complex programs can be difficult to maintain due to dependencies throughout the program. OOP lets programmers write programs in a manner that reduces dependencies and makes maintenance easier.

B. OOP lets programmers write more efficient programs that consume less memory, less disk space, and less computing power.

C. Complex coding problems are often difficult to break down and solve clearly and systematically. Using OOP to model objects and using real-world nouns to represent objects lets programmers think at a higher level of abstraction. That, in turn, helps them break down and solve problems.

D. Large programs involve writing a great deal of code. Using OOP lets programmers write shorter programs than the equivalent procedural code.

Discussion

Incorrect:

B: Some OO programs may be more efficient in some ways, but that is not a universal truth, and it's rarely true that an OO program is more efficient in all respects.

D: Most OO programs need more code than the equivalent non-OO programs.

Question 3

Which of the following statements are true when talking about encapsulation? Select all that apply.

Your Answer

A. JavaScript uses access restrictions to enforce encapsulation. That is, it hides certain states and behaviors from other objects.

B. Encapsulation is the ability of different objects to respond in different ways to the same message.

C. Encapsulation is a way to share common behaviors between classes.

D. Encapsulation refers to how we can bundle state (data) and behavior (the operations relevant to that data) into a single entity (an object).

Discussion

Incorrect:

A: JavaScript doesn't have an access restriction mechanism. There are ways to achieve a degree of access restriction, but they're not perfect.

B: This is a description of polymorphism, not encapsulation. We'll talk about polymorphism later.

C: This is something that you would do using mix-ins or inheritance, and isn't a description of encapsulation.

Question 4

What do we mean when we refer to the interface of an object? Choose all answers that apply.

Your Answer: B (correct)

A. The method lookup path for the object.

B. The state and behaviors exposed by the object for other objects to use.

C. The instance properties that record the state of an object.

D. The utility methods used internally by the object.
