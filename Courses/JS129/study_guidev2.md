## OOP Introduction

Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm in which we think about problems in terms of using objects to organize our program. In OOP the idea is to model a program based on how objects in the real world interact. A real-world object like a car, for example, has **state** -- *properties* -- like color, number of doors and fuel-level amongst others. It also has **behavior**; it can be started, driven, steered, or parked. That's precisely how we think about problems in OOP: as a set of objects with state and behavior. OOP is about *combining data and behavior* into an object.

The Four Pillars of OOP are APIE: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of OOP

- Advantages
  - It lets programmers think about a problem at a higher-level of abstraction, which helps them break down and solve the problem.
  - OOP helps programmers write programs that reduce the *dependencies* in a program, which makes maintenance easier.
  - Done right, OOP makes code flexible, easy to understand, and easy to change.

- Disadvantages
  - OOP programs are often much larger than the equivalent procedural program.
  - OOP may lead to less efficient code; OO programs may require more memory, disk space, and computing power.

## 1. Objects, Object Factories (Factory Functions), Constructors and Prototypes, OLOO, and ES6 Classes

### 1.1 Objects

The simplest way to create a JavaScript object is to use the **object literal** syntax: a pair of opening and closing curly braces. Adding methods to an objects is as simple as adding a function as the value of a property.

#### 1.1.1 Encapsulating the data and functionality of a race car into an object

```js
let raceCar = {

  make: 'BMW',
  fuelLevel: 0.5,
  engineOn: false,

  startEngine: function() {
    raceCar.engineOn = true;
  },

  drive: function() {
    raceCar.fuelLevel -= 0.1;
  },

  stopEngine() { // <-- compact method syntax that omits the `:` and the `function` keyword
    raceCar.engineOn = false;
  },

  refuel: function(percent) {
    if ((raceCar.fuelLevel + (percent / 100)) <= 1) {
      raceCar.fuelLevel += (percent / 100);
    } else {
      raceCar.fuelLevel = 1;
    }
  },
};

raceCar.refuel(30); // Use dot-notation to call a method.
```

This code bundles the data and operations related to a car into an object. The structure of the object is essentially the same as the objects we've encountered so far. The chief difference is that *some of the property values are functions*. When object properties have function values, we call them **methods**. The methods here are responsible for changing the state of the `raceCar` object.

Note that JavaScript won't stop you from changing the `fuelLevel` property directly instead of calling the `refuel` method. That's a limitation of JavaScript. The OO style strongly discourages changing property values directly. Instead, it encourages using methods to interface with the object. We can see why that is by looking at the implementation for `refuel`. The `fuelLevel` property should be a number that's a fraction of 1. The `refuel` method ensures that it never exceeds that value. If you only use `refuel` to increase the `fuelLevel` of the car, it'll never exceed 1. If you directly access and change `fuelLevel`, though, you may end up violating that restriction.

#### 1.1.2 Property Access

When dealing with objects, we are basically doing either one of two things: *setting a property* or *accessing a property*. We do both operations through the property key by using bracket notation or dot notation.

```js
myObject["foo"] = "bar";
myObject.foo              // "bar"
myObject["foo"]           // "bar"
```

Dot notation is also called **member access notation**, while bracket notation is called **computed member access notation**. The main difference between the two is that bracket notation can take any UTF-8-compatible string as the key, while member access notation requires valid variable names. Most importantly, computed member access notation can be computed on the fly -- *any expression between the brackets gets evaluated as a string and used to reference the property*.

```js
myObject["a-key"] = 'four';

myObject.a-key // SyntaxError (a-key is not a valid variable name)
myObject["a-key"] // 'four'
myObject["a" + "-" + "key"] // 'four'
```

#### 1.1.3 Property Existence

What happens if we access a non-existent property on an object? We get `undefined`. However, we also get the same value when we try to access a property that is explicitly set to `undefined`.

```js
Object.keys(myObject)  //  [ '7', 'false', '1,2,3', 'a-key' ]
myObject[undefinedKey] = undefined

myObject.undefinedKey // undefined
myObject.missingKey  // undefined
```

That’s a dilemma. How do we distinguish one from the other? There are two ways to do that:

- `in` operator
- `hasOwnProperty`

Both methods check if a property exists in an object. If it does, `true` is returned, and `false` otherwise.

```js
Object.keys(myObject)  //  [ '7', 'false', '1,2,3', 'a-key' ]

"false" in myObject // true
"true" in myObject // false

myObject.hasOwnProperty('7') // true
myObject.hasOwnProperty('8') // false
```

If they both do the same thing, why the need for duplication? They are not exactly identical. There is a difference but it’s something we have to cover in future assignments. What’s important to note for now is that both `in` operator as well as `hasOwnProperty()` allows us to check for property existence in an object.

Another indirect way of checking for property existence is to enumerate the properties of an object via `Object.keys` or `Object.getOwnPropertyNames`. Both return an array of the object’s properties. The difference is that `Object.keys` returns an array of enumerable properties while `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns all properties regardless if they’re enumerable or not.

```js
Object.keys(myObject) // [ '7', 'false', '1,2,3', 'a-key', 'undefinedKey' ]
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(myObject) // [ '7', 'false', '1,2,3', 'a-key', 'undefinedKey' ]
```

### 1.2 Object Factories / Factory Functions

One way to *automate the creation of objects* is to use the **factory function pattern**. A factory function returns an object with a particular set of methods and properties. The methods remain the same across the objects, while the property values can be customized by providing them as arguments. Factory functions instantiate and return a new object in the function body. They let us create new objects based on a predefined template.

An object factory serves two purposes:

1. It returns objects that represent data of a specific type.
2. It reuses code.

However, they have two significant downsides:

1. There is no way to inspect an object and learn whether we created it with a factory function. That effectively *makes it impossible to identify the specific "type" of the object*; at best, you can only determine that an object has some specific characteristics.
2. Every object created with a factory function has a full copy of all the methods. That's **redundant**, and it can place a heavy load on system memory.

#### 1.2.1 Factory Function Example 1 - `createCar`

```js
function createCar(make, model, year) {
  return {
    make,         // Same as "make: make"
    model,        // Same as "model: model"
    year,         // Same as "year: year"
    started: false,

    start() {     // Same as "start: function() {"
      this.started = true;
    },

    stop() {      // Same as "stop: function() {"
      this.started = false;
    },
  };
}

let car1 = createCar('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
let car2 = createCar('Honda', 'Civic', 2017);

// my addition
let car3 = createCar('Tesla', 'Model X', 2022);
```

The `createCar` function takes three arguments and returns a car object with four properties and two methods. With this `createCar` **object factory**, you can create as many car objects as your program needs. In this case, `createCar` handles the similarities, while each invocation specifies the differences with arguments.

Factory functions give us the ability to create objects of the same type by merely calling a function. Entities that are common to multiple objects, such as the `start` and `stop` methods, get declared in one place. On the other hand, *arguments are passed to the factory function* to distinguish one object from another, such as the make, model, and year. Some entities, like `started`, don't fall easily into either category, but that's not important here.

**Compact Method Syntax** - omits the `:` and the `function` keyword and uses parenthesis to denote a method.

#### 1.2.1 Factory Function Example 2 - `createPerson`

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName = '') {
  let person = {};

  person.firstName = firstName;
  person.lastName = lastName;

  person.fullName = function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`.trim();
  };

  return person;
}

let john = createPerson('John', 'Doe');
let jane = createPerson('Jane');

john.fullName(); // => 'John Doe'
jane.fullName(); // => 'Jane'
```

We can simplify that somewhat by *returning an object literal*:

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName = '') {
  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,

    fullName: function() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`.trim();
    }
  };
}
```

#### 1.2.1 Factory Function Example 3

```js
function createRectangle(width, length) {
  return {
    width: width, // width,
    length: length, // length,

    getWidth() {
      return this.width;
    },

    getLength() {
      return this.length;
    },

    getArea() {
      return this.width * this.length;
    },
  };
}

let rectangle = createRectangle(4, 5);

// console.log(rectangle.getWidth()); // 4
// console.log(rectangle.getLength()); // 5
// console.log(rectangle.getArea()); // 20
```

### 1.3 Constructors and Prototypes

#### 1.3.1 Object Constructors / Constructors

**Object constructors**, or **constructors** are another way to create objects in JavaScript.  Superficially, a constructor looks and acts a lot like a factory function: you define a constructor once then invoke it each time you want to create an object of that type.

Constructor functions are meant to be invoked with the `new` operator. They instantiate a new object behind the scenes and let the developer manipulate it through the `this` keyword. A typical constructor uses the following pattern:

1. The constructor is invoked with `new`.
2. The JS runtime creates a new object that inherits from the constructor's prototype object.
3. The new object is assigned to `this` within the function body.
4. The code in the function body is executed.
5. The function returns the object referenced by `this` unless the function returns an explicit object.

#### 1.3.2 Prototypes

Every function has a `prototype` property that points to an object that contains a `constructor` property. The `constructor` property points back to the function itself. Thus, if `Kumquat` is a construction function, then `Kumquat.prototype.constructor === Kumquat`.

If the function is used as a constructor, the returned object's `[[Prototype]]` will reference the constructor's `prototype` property. That lets us set properties on the constructor's prototype object so that all objects created by the constructor will share them. We call this the **pseudo-classical** pattern of object creation.

#### 1.3.3. Example

We don't just want *a* car, however. We want a mechanism that creates any car that has those properties and methods. To do that, we can use a factory function to create individual cars. Another way to accomplish the same thing is to use a constructor function and the `new` keyword:

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.started = false;

  this.start = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  this.stop = function() {
    this.started = false;
  };
}

let corolla = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
let leaf = new Car('Nissan', 'LEAF', 2018);
let nova = new Car('Chevrolet', 'Nova', 1974);
```

Defining a constructor is nearly identical to defining an ordinary function, but there are differences. For starters, notice that *we gave the constructor a name that begins with a capital letter*: `Car`. Capitalizing the name isn't a language requirement, but it is a convention employed by most JavaScript developers.

The function parameters, in general, match the properties associated with each `Car` object. In this case, we supply parameters for all of the properties except `started`, which receives an initial value instead. *The initial value for such properties can come from anywhere.* For instance, we can compute the value from other properties or retrieve a value from a database.

#### 1.3.4 Calling a Constructor Function

The most striking features that distinguish **constructors** from ordinary functions are that:

- we call it with the `new` keyword,
- we use `this` to set the object's properties and methods, and
- we *don't supply an explicit return value* (we can, but usually don't).

By now, we know that `this` always refers to an object. Its value depends on how we call the function. Calling constructors is where you see the most significant difference between them and other functions.

Let's create a `Car` object:

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.started = false;

  this.start = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  this.stop = function() {
    this.started = false;
  };
}

let corolla = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);

corolla.make;    // => 'Toyota'
corolla.model;   // => 'Corolla'
corolla.year;    // => 2016
corolla.started; // => false

corolla.start();
corolla.started; // => true
```

Notice that the `new` keyword precedes the function invocation. This combination of using `new` with a function call *treats the function as a constructor*.

JavaScript takes the following steps when you invoke a function with `new`:

1. It creates an entirely new object.
2. It sets the prototype of the new object to the object that is referenced by the constructor's `prototype` property.
3. It sets the value of `this` for use inside the function to point to the new object.
4. It invokes the function. Since `this` refers to the new object, we use it within the function to set the object's properties and methods.
5. Finally, once the function finishes running, `new` returns the new object even though we don't explicitly return anything.

We can now use the new object in any manner appropriate for a `Car` object.

**JavaScript won't complain about a missing `new` keyword.**

```js
Car(); // => undefined
```

If you don't use the `new` keyword, the constructor function won't work as intended. Instead, it acts like an ordinary function. In particular, no new objects are created, so `this` won't point to a new object.

Furthermore, since functions that don't return an explicit value return `undefined`, calling a constructor without `new` also returns `undefined`. When you use `new`, however, the function doesn't have to return anything explicitly: it returns the newly created object automatically.

#### 1.3.5 Who Can be a Constructor

You can use `new` to call almost any JavaScript function that you create. However, *you cannot call arrow functions with `new`* since they use their surrounding context as the value of `this`:

```js
let Car = (make, model, year) => {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

new Car(); // TypeError: Car is not a constructor
```

You *can also use* `new` on methods that you define in objects. Consider:

```js
let foo = {
  Car: function(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
};

let car1 = new foo.Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2019);
car1.make; //=> 'Toyota'
```

However, *calling a method defined with concise syntax* (also called a concise method) *won't work*:

```js
let foo = {
  Car(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
};

new foo.Car(); //=> Uncaught TypeError: foo.Car is not a constructor
```

In addition, many -- but not all -- built-in objects and methods are *incompatible* with `new`:

```js

new console.log(); //=> Uncaught TypeError: console.log is not a constructor
new Math();        //=> Uncaught TypeError: Math is not a constructor
new parseInt("3"); //=> Uncaught TypeError: parseInt is not a constructor

new Date();        //=> 2019-06-26T02:50:20.191Z
```

#### 1.3.6 Constructors with Explicit Return Values

What happens when you use `new` to call a function that returns an explicit value?

```js
function Cat(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;

  return 'a cat';
}

let fluffy = new Cat('fluffy', 'Persian', 15);
console.log(fluffy) // Cat { name: 'fluffy', breed: 'Persian', weight: 15 }
fluffy.weight; // 15
```

That's curious. Even though we explicitly returned the string `'a cat'`, our constructor returned the `Cat` object with `name`, `breed` and `weight` as its properties.

Note that `'a cat'` is a **primitive value**. Suppose we returned an object instead. What would happen, then?

```js
function Cat(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;

  return { foo: 1 };
}

let fluffy = new Cat('fluffy', 'Persian', 15);
console.log(fluffy) // { foo: 1 }
fluffy.weight; // undefined
fluffy.foo; // 1
```

This time the constructor returned the object `{ foo: 1 }`, not a cat object.

The rule here is that a constructor that explicitly tries to return an object returns that object instead of a new object of the desired type. In all other situations, it returns the newly created object, provided no errors occur. In particular, *the constructor ignores primitive return values and returns the new object instead*.

#### 1.3.7 Supplying Constructor Arguments with Plain Objects

Constructor functions sometimes have to grow with the needs of a program. That often means adding more arguments to the constructor. For instance, our `Car` constructor may one day end up looking like this:

```js
function Car(make, model, year, color, passengers, convertible, mileage) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.color = color;
  this.passengers = passengers;
  this.convertible = convertible;
  this.mileage = mileage;
  this.started = false;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of the methods
}
```

That's quite a few parameters, with plenty of opportunities for mistakes. For instance, we may *pass the arguments in the wrong order*, and JavaScript won't complain. The more parameters a function needs, the harder it is to read the code and the more likely that problems will arise.

One common technique that we can use to manage our parameters better involves *passing them to our constructor with an object argument*:

```js
let civicArgs = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Civic',
  year: 2016,
  color: 'black',
  passengers: 5,
  convertible: false,
  mileage: 16000
}

let civic = new Car(civicArgs);
```

Of course, that means that we now have to rework our `Car` constructor to accept an object as an argument:

```js
function Car(args) {
  this.make = args.make;
  this.model = args.model;
  this.year = args.year;
  this.color = args.color;
  this.passengers = args.passengers;
  this.convertible = args.convertible;
  this.mileage = args.mileage;
  this.started = false;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of methods
}
```

With `Object.assign`, we can simplify this constructor considerably:

```js
function Car(args) {
  Object.assign(this, args);

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of methods
}
```

However, one drawback of the `Object.assign` approach is that the `args` object may contain properties that the `Car` object doesn't need. Those additional properties will, nevertheless, get added to the `Car` object. Those properties may just be excess baggage for the objects to carry around, but they *may also cause trouble*.

#### 1.3.8 Determining an Object's Type

Many object-oriented languages, like Java or C++, have a strong notion of object types. In most such languages, it's easy to determine the object's type, such as a dog or car. JavaScript, however, treats objects and their types in a looser, more dynamic way. You can't determine the specific type of arbitrary JavaScript objects; they are dynamic structures with a type of `object`, no matter what properties and methods they have. However, *we can get some useful information about an object if we know which constructor created it*.

Remember that the `new` operator creates a new object. Suppose that you call the `Car` constructor with `new`. Informally, we can say that the resulting object is a car. More formally, we can say that the object is an **instance** of a `Car`.

The `instanceof` operator lets us determine whether a given constructor created an object:

```js
function Car(args) {
  this.make = args.make;
  this.model = args.model;
  this.year = args.year;
  this.color = args.color;
  this.passengers = args.passengers;
  this.convertible = args.convertible;
  this.mileage = args.mileage;
  this.started = false;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of methods
}

let civicArgs = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Civic',
  year: 2016,
  color: 'black',
  passengers: 5,
  convertible: false,
  mileage: 16000
};

let civic = new Car(civicArgs);

if (civic instanceof Car) {
  console.log("It's a car!");
} else {
  console.log("It's not a car.");
}

// It's a car!
```

One effect that we didn't mention when talking about the `new` operator is that *the object it returns contains some information that ties it back to the constructor that created the object*. The `instanceof` operator uses that information to determine what constructor created the object.

#### 1.3.9 Constructors with Prototypes

In the previous assignment, we learned how to use constructor functions as factories that create objects. One question we didn't answer, however, was why we need to have constructor functions along with their somewhat strange use of `this` and `new`. We can accomplish practically the same thing with object factories. We'll answer that question in this assignment.

Let's take a closer look at what happens when we create some objects with a constructor (but without a prototype?):

```js
function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;

  this.bark = function() {
    console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
  };
}

let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
let dexter = new Dog('Dexter', 'Rottweiler', 50);
let biggie = new Dog('Biggie', 'Whippet', 9);

maxi.bark(); // 'Woof!'
```

Each of these dog objects, when created, receive the `name`, `breed`, and `weight` properties as well as the `bark` method. The properties have values that differ between objects, but the `bark` method remains the same in all. However, every time we create a new dog object, we must create a new `bark` method so we can add it to the object. We can verify that each object has its own `bark` method with `hasOwnProperty`:

```js
maxi.hasOwnProperty('bark');   // true
dexter.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // true
biggie.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // true
maxi.bark === dexter.bark;     // false
maxi.bark === biggie.bark;     // false
dexter.bark === biggie.bark;   // false
```

If that seems inefficient and wasteful to you, you're right! We're not repeating any code, but the runtime must create a new copy of the method every time we create an object. For small programs with few objects like this one, that may not be a problem. However, when you start getting into hundreds or thousands or even millions of objects, the multiple function objects can be hard on resources, especially on devices with little memory. Wouldn't it be nice if we could create the `bark` method just once rather than using a different copy of that method in every dog object?

#### 1.3.10 Method Delegation to Prototypes

Earlier, we learned that we could use prototypes to share code between objects of the same type. Prototypes are especially useful for sharing methods as all objects of a particular type share the same prototype object. Furthermore, delegation means that we can share methods by putting them in the prototype object; if an object doesn't contain a requested method, JavaScript searches the prototype chain to find the method.

Thus, we can define a method once in the prototype object, and let the inheriting objects delegate the method calls to the prototype. We can use prototypes in conjunction with constructors to achieve the same result:

```js
let DogPrototype = {
  bark() {
    console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
  }
};

function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  Object.setPrototypeOf(this, DogPrototype);
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;
  // this.bark method removed.
}
```

In this code, we've changed our `Dog` constructor and created a `DogPrototype` object. The first thing we do inside the constructor is set `DogPrototype` as the prototype of the newly created dog object. We then assign the arguments to the properties.

Note that we can continue to use our constructor without change:

```js
let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
let dexter = new Dog('Dexter', 'Rottweiler', 50);
let biggie = new Dog('Biggie', 'Whippet', 9);

maxi.bark(); // 'Woof!'
```

This time, however, the `bark` method isn't defined on the individual objects, but is, instead, defined on the `[[Prototype]]` property:

```js
maxi.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
dexter.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
biggie.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
Object.getPrototypeOf(maxi).bark === DogPrototype.bark; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(dexter).bark === DogPrototype.bark; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(biggie).bark === DogPrototype.bark; // true
```

The `DogPrototype` object has the only copy of the method; all dog objects delegate `bark` to the `DogPrototype` object. If you have dozens of dog objects in your program, it's easy to see that adding prototypes into the mix can make better use of memory.

Okay, we now have a constructor and a related prototype object. Together, they construct objects of some type. In our code here, we can guess that the constructor and prototype are related by looking at their names. However, it would be better if we could establish that relationship more concretely. Let's assign the prototype object to a property of the `Dog` function.

```js
// Delete DogPrototype

function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  Object.setPrototypeOf(this, Dog.myPrototype);
  // rest of the code
}

Dog.myPrototype = {
  bark() {
    console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
  }
};
```

Since JavaScript functions are objects, we can add properties to them. Here, we assign the prototype object to a `myPrototype` property on the `Dog` function object. Thus, we clearly show our intent that all dogs inherit from the `Dog.myPrototype` object. Once we've done that, we can change our constructor function to use `Dog.myPrototype` as the prototype object.

Take some time to understand why this code works. It can be confusing when you first encounter it. It's a little like working with **recursive functions** as we did in the [Introduction to Programming With JavaScript book](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/loops_iterating#recursion), which is to say, it's a bit hard to wrap your head around this code. To help, here's the complete code as it now stands:

```js
function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  Object.setPrototypeOf(this, Dog.myPrototype);
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;
}

Dog.myPrototype = {
  bark() {
    console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
  }
};

let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
let dexter = new Dog('Dexter', 'Rottweiler', 50);
let biggie = new Dog('Biggie', 'Whippet', 9);

maxi.bark(); // 'Woof!'

maxi.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
dexter.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false
biggie.hasOwnProperty('bark'); // false

Object.getPrototypeOf(maxi).bark === Dog.myPrototype.bark; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(dexter).bark === Dog.myPrototype.bark; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(biggie).bark === Dog.myPrototype.bark; // true
```

#### 1.3.11 The Constructor `prototype` Property

So far, so good. We have a constructor function and a prototype object that work together. Between them, they create dog objects for us that don't waste memory with multiple copies of methods. However, we still haven't explained why we should bother with constructors. We can pair a prototype with a factory function and get the same effect.

What makes constructors special is a characteristic of all function objects in JavaScript: they all have a prototype property that we call the **function prototype** to distinguish them from the prototypes used when creating ordinary objects. The code we showed in the previous section emulates something that JavaScript bundles with constructors. Let's take a look at that property:

```sh
Dog.prototype; // => Dog {}
```

When you call a function `Foo` with the `new` keyword, JavaScript sets the new object's prototype to the current value of `Foo`'s `prototype` property. That is, the constructor creates an object that inherits from the constructor function's prototype (`Foo.prototype`). Since inheritance in JavaScript uses prototypes, we can also say that the constructor creates an object whose prototype references `Foo.prototype`.

The terminology of constructor prototypes and object prototypes is extremely confusing. Note in particular that we use the term "prototype" to refer to 2 distinct but related concepts:

1. If `bar` is an object, then the object from which `bar` inherits is the **object prototype**. By default, constructor functions set the object prototype for the objects they create to the constructor's prototype object.

2. The **constructor's prototype object**, also called the **function prototype**, is an object that the constructor uses as the object prototype for the objects it creates. In other words, each object that the constructor creates inherits from the constructor's prototype object. The constructor stores its prototype object in its `prototype` property; that is, if the constructor's name is `Foo`, then `Foo.prototype` references the constructor's prototype object.

It's easy to get confused about the differences between these two kinds of prototypes. Be sure you understand the differences before moving on. In most cases, when we talk about a **prototype** without being more explicit, we mean an **object prototype**. We'll talk about the constructor's prototype, the function prototype, or the `prototype` property when talking about a constructor's prototype object.

Note that *constructors don't inherit from the constructor's prototype object*. Instead, *the objects that the constructor creates inherit from it*

As we've said before, every JavaScript function has a `prototype` property. However, JavaScript only uses it when you call that function as a constructor, that is, by using the `new` keyword. With this information, we can abandon our home-grown constructor-prototype pairing and use the one that JavaScript provides instead:

```js
function Dog (name, breed, weight) {
  // deleted Object.setPrototypeOf(this, Dog.myPrototype);
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;
}

Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
  console.log(this.weight > 20 ? 'Woof!' : 'Yip!');
};

let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
maxi.bark(); // 'Woof!'

let biggie = new Dog('Biggie', 'Whippet', 9);
biggie.bark(); // 'Yip!'
```

Here's a diagram illustrating the `prototype` and `constructor` links we've discussed.

![constructor-prototype-map](constructor-prototype-map.png)

Note that our constructor doesn't have to explicitly set the prototype of `this` to `Dog.prototype`. JavaScript does that for us when we call the function with `new`. We left this detail out earlier, so let's restate those steps with updated information. We'll assume that the constructor function is named `Foo`:

1. It creates an entirely new object.
2. It sets `Foo.prototype` as the prototype for the new object. That is, the new object inherits from the object referenced by `Foo.prototype`.
3. It sets the execution context (`this`) for the function to point to the new object.
4. It invokes the function.
5. It returns the new object *unless the function returns another object*.

Since the `bark` method refers to `this` and `bark` belongs to the prototype object, you may think that `this` in `this.weight` refers to the prototype object rather than the object itself (e.g., `maxi` or `biggie`). However, that's not how `this` binding works. You already know those rules, so take a moment to think about what it means inside the `bark` method.

When you call a method on an object, JavaScript binds `this` to the object whose method you used to call it. If it doesn't find the method in that object, but it does find it in the prototype, that doesn't change the value of `this`. `this` always refers to the original object -- that is, the object used to call the method --even if the method is in the prototype. If we find the `bark` method in the prototype, `this` references the original dog object, not the prototype.

A property of interest on a prototype object is the constructor property. For instance:

```sh
Dog.prototype.constructor; // [Function: Dog]
```

As with the `instanceof` operator, the `constructor` property lets us determine the type of an object:

```js
let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);

if (maxi.constructor === Dog) {
  console.log("It's a dog");
} else {
  console.log("It's not a dog");
}
```

Be careful, however. It's possible to reassign the `constructor` property to something else. We'll learn about reassigning the `constructor` property in the next assignment. In that case, the test shown above would fail, even though the object is still a dog.

```js
Dog.prototype.constructor = function() {};

maxi.constructor === Dog; // false
maxi instanceof Dog;      // true
```

Note that `instanceOf` still works.

#### 1.3.12 Overriding the Prototype

Inheriting methods from a prototype doesn't mean that the inheriting object is stuck with those methods. *JavaScript objects are incredibly dynamic and flexible*. Two objects created with the same constructor may end up looking completely different from each other because of changes and additions made after constructing the object. For instance, suppose we have a `dexter` dog that has an unusually loud and deep bark. We want to change the `bark` method to log `WOOF!` instead of `Woof!`. We can do that easily by defining a custom `bark` method on `dexter`.

```js
let maxi = new Dog('Maxi', 'German Shepherd', 32);
let dexter = new Dog('Dexter', 'Rottweiler', 50);

dexter.bark = function() {
  console.log('WOOF!');
}

maxi.bar(); // Woof!
dexter.bark(); // WOOF!
```

The `dexter` object now has its own `bark` method that **overrides** the `bark` method from `Dog.prototype`. Each time we call `bark` on `dexter`, JavaScript looks for it first in the `dexter` object itself. Since it finds it there, it doesn't need to check the prototype.

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getWidth = function() {
  return this.width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getLength = function() {
  return this.length;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.width * this.length;
}

let rectangle1 = new Rectangle(5, 4);
console.log(rectangle1.getWidth()); // 4
console.log(rectangle1.getLength()); // 5
console.log(rectangle1.getArea()); // 20
```

The reason we get the following output is because the `new` operator sets the context to the new object that's created. Because of this, technically a, b, c etc. don't exist as properties on the constructor, they exist as properties in the instantiated object.

```js
function MyClass(a, b, c, d, e, f) {
  this.a = a;
  this.b = b;
  this.c = c;
  this.d = d;
  this.e = e;
  this.f = f;
}

let func = new MyClass(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(func)); // [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' ]
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(MyClass)); // [ 'length', 'name', 'arguments', 'caller', 'prototype' ]
```

#### 1.3.13 Subtyping with Constructors and Prototypes

In an earlier lesson, we learned how to use constructors together with prototypes to create objects of the same type. The combination of constructors and prototypes gives us something that resembles a **class**, a construct used in classical OOP languages like Java, Python, and Ruby. A *class is a blueprint for creating objects*. Traditional OOP languages use classes to create distinct objects of a particular type and give those objects the behaviors and state that they need.

Constructors and prototypes let us mimic classes in JavaScript. Until recently, the language had nothing that you could reasonably call a class. That made it hard for developers familiar with class-based languages to switch to JavaScript. One can even argue that constructors and prototypes are part of the language solely to make it easier for developers to switch to JavaScript.

An essential part of the OO paradigm is the concept of inheritance. In most OOP languages, inheritance means something a bit different from the way we use it in conjunction with JavaScript. That can make JavaScript inheritance confusing if you've seen inheritance in other languages. For now, it may be wise to forget what you think you know about inheritance based on those other languages.

Let's look at an example that shows why we might need inheritance in an application. Assume that we have a drawing application that lets the user work with shapes. In this app, the constructor/prototype combination for rectangles might look like this:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length;
  this.width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

Rectangle.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Rectangle ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}
```

We can create and manipulate `Rectangle` objects like so:

```js
let rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
rect.getArea(); // => 50
rect.toString(); // '[Rectangle 10 x 5]'
```

Our `Rectangle` constructor creates rectangle objects that have `width` and `length` as properties and the methods `getArea` and `toString`.

Suppose our application also needs squares. We can set up another constructor/prototype combination for those squares, and then follow the same pattern we used for rectangles:

```js
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

Square.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
};

let sqr = new Square(5);
sqr.getArea();     // => 25
sqr.toString();    // => "[Square 5 x 5]"
```

There's some code duplication between this code and the `Rectangle` code. In particular, `Square.prototype.getArea` and `Rectangle.prototype.getArea` are identical. That gives us a chance to reuse some code.

We can *use prototypal inheritance to our advantage here*. One way to think about the relationship between `Square` and `Rectangle` is that a square is a special kind of rectangle where both the length and width are the same. We say that `Square` is a **sub-type** of `Rectangle`, or that `Rectangle` is a **super-type** of `Square`. Consider the following code:

```js
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);

Square.prototype.toString() = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
};

let sqr = new Square(5);
sqr.getArea(); // => 25
sqr.toString(); // "[Square 5 x 5]"
```

Since a function's `prototype` property is writable -- we can change what object it references -- we can reassign `Square.prototype` to an object that inherits from `Rectangle.prototype`. The result is a prototype chain that looks like this:

```js
sqr ---> Square.prototype ---> Rectangle.prototype ---> Object.prototype
```

All objects created by the `Square` constructor inherit from `Square.prototype`, which we have set up to inherit from `Rectangle.prototype`. Thus, all square objects have access to methods on `Rectangle.prototype`. Since `toString` must be different for squares, we override it in `Square.prototype`. That is, we customize `Square.prototype.toString`. Since `getArea` *requires no customization*, we can let square objects use the inherited `Rectangle.prototype.getArea`.

#### 1.3.14 Restoring the `constructor` property

One side-effect of this approach is that the `constructor` property on square objects points to `Rectangle` when it should point to `Square` instead:

```js
// omitted code

sqr.constructor === Rectangle; // => true
```

Why does that happen? It happens since we reassign `Square.prototype` to a new object that inherits from `Rectangle.prototype`, and the `constructor` property for `Rectangle.prototype` points back to `Rectangle`. Thus, `Square.prototype.constructor` points to `Rectangle`. To fix this situation, we merely need to reassign `Square.prototype.constructor` to `Square`:

```js
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);
Square.prototype.constructor = Square; // <-- reassign

Square.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}

let sqr = new Square(5);
sqr.getArea(); // => 25
sqr.toString(); // => '[Square 5 x 5]'
sqr.constructor = Square; // => true
```

Why do we need to reassign the constructor property? In most cases, failure to reassign it won't hurt anything, and it certainly doesn't in this code. However, there are [situations where the value of the `constructor` property is important](https://2ality.com/2011/06/constructor-property.html).

#### 1.3.15 Constructor Reuse

If you examine the bodies of the `Rectangle` and `Square` functions, you'll see that they're similar. That suggests that we may be able to use the `Rectangle` constructor in `Square`. To do that, we must *invoke `Rectangle` with its execution context explicitly set to the execution context of `Square`*:

```js
function Square(size) {
  Rectangle.call(this, size, size);
}
```

Our code now looks like this:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.area;
}

Rectangle.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Rectangle ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}

// rect test code omitted

function Square(size) {
  Rectangle.call(this, size, size);
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);
Square.prototype.constructor = Square;

Square.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}

// sqr test code omittted
```

The combination of constructors and prototypes provides a way of mimicking classical inheritance with JavaScript. This lets us create **subtype** objects, which can 'inherit' methods from a **supertype** object. This is one way of facilitating code re-use.

### 1.4 OLOO (Objects Linking to Other Objects)

The **Objects Linking to Other Objects (OLOO)** pattern of object creation uses a prototype object, an initializer method, and the `Object.create()` method to create objects with shared behavior (e.g., car objects). The initializer customizes the state for each object, and is usually named `init`. All objects of the same type inherit from the prototype. Thus OLOO uses prototypal inheritance.

What properties are common to all car objects? Here, those properties are the `start` and `stop` methods. All cars have `make`, `model`, `year`, and `started` properties as well, but each object has different values for those properties. Thus, we don't count them as being common to all cars.

We can extract the `start` and `stop` methods to a prototype object.

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },
};
```

Now that we have a car prototype object, all car objects can inherit from it:

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.make = 'Toyota';
car1.model = 'Corolla';
car1.year = 2016;
```

We can now call `start` and `stop` on the `car1` object since both are accessible through it prototype, `carPrototype`.

```js
car1.start();
car1.started; // => true

car1.stop();
car1.started; // => false
```

Calling `start` and `stop` on the `car1` object changes the state of `car1` even though those methods don't belong to `car1`. That shouldn't come as a surprise since we're using `car1` as the execution context for the calls. When we call these methods, `this` is set to `car1`, so the methods change the `started` property in `car1`.

That's all well and good. We've set up a car prototype that all our car objects can inherit. However, we still have a small problem: *we must set the `make`, `model`, and `year` properties manually every time we create a car object*. Can we automate that? Fortunately, yes; there's more than one way. The most common technique uses an `init` method on the prototype object:

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },

  init(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  },
};
```

We can then use it like so:

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.init('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
```

This code is certainly better, but we still need two lines of code to create a new car object. A small improvement to our `init` method can change that as well:

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },

  init(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    return this; // <-- small improvement to the `init` method
  },
};
```

Since `init` now returns a reference to the car object it was called on, we can chain `create` and `init` and assign the result to the `car1` variable.

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype).init('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
```

### 1.4.1 Another Example of OLOO

```js
// OLOO (uses `init` and an explicit return in the constructor)
let rectanglePrototype = {
  init(length, width) {
    this.width = width;
    this.length = length;
    return this;
  },

  getWidth() {
    return this.width;
  },

  getLength() {
    return this.length;
  },

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.length;
  },
};

let olooRectangle = Object.create(rectanglePrototype).init(5, 4);

console.log(olooRectangle.getWidth()); // 4
console.log(olooRectangle.getLength()); // 5
console.log(olooRectangle.getArea()); // 20
```

### 1.4.2 Advantage of OLOO over Factory Functions

You can use both factory functions and the OLOO pattern to bulk create objects of the same type. Though the result is an object creation mechanism in both cases, the OLOO pattern has one significant advantage over factory functions: **memory efficiency**. Since all objects created with the OLOO pattern *inherit methods from a single prototype object*, the objects that inherit from that prototype object share the same methods. Factory functions, on the other hand, create copies of all the methods for each new object. That can have a significant performance impact, especially on smaller devices with limited memory.

However, that doesn't mean that OLOO is decidedly better than the factory pattern. An advantage of the factory pattern is that it lets us *create objects with private state*. If that doesn't make sense to you yet, don't worry. We'll return to this topic in a later course when we discuss **closures**.

### 1.5 ES6 Classes

#### 1.5.1 [Classes Introduction](https://launchschool.com/gists/6ba85481)

The ECMAScript 6 (ES6) standard added the `class` keyword to JavaScript. In effect, classes act like **syntactic sugar** -- syntax designed to be easier to read or use -- that makes it easier for programmers to migrate to JavaScript from other OOP languages. In essence, they provide little more than a more natural and possibly familiar way to create constructors and prototypes.

The syntax for defining classes is similar to that of defining functions. In particular, both functions and classes have two significant definition styles: declarations and expressions. We'll examine how classes do that in this assignment.

ES6 classes provide a cleaner, more compact alternative to constructors and prototypes. As with functions, they are first-class citizens and come in the form of declarations and expressions. Functionally, classes behave almost identically to the constructors and prototypes they aim to replace. Classes allow for static methods by using the `static` modifier.

The class syntax, a relatively new addition to JavaScript, is **syntactic sugar** (cleaner syntax) for creating objects that use constructors and prototypes. JavaScript classes make it look more like a classical OO language to make the transition smoother for developers who have experience working with other OO languages.

A class is a kind of template for creating concrete objects of that type. Each concrete object is called an instance of the class. The process of creating an instance is performed by a special function called a constructor. We pass the constructor values for any internal state that we want to initialize in the new instance.

#### 1.5.2 A Simple Type

Before we get into the `class` syntax, let's first define a simple `Rectangle` type using the familiar **constructor** and **prototype** pattern:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

let rec = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(typeof Rectangle);         // function
console.log(rec instanceof Rectangle); // true
console.log(rec.constructor);          // [Function: Rectangle]
console.log(rec.getArea());            // 50
```

The object created by the `Rectangle` constructor, `rec`, is an instance of the `Rectangle` type, and we can call the `getArea` method from its prototype to calculate the area.

It's interesting to note that you can call the `Rectangle` constructor without the `new` keyword. However, if you do, the constructor won't work properly. It's possible to write constructors that work with or without the `new` keyword, but most JavaScript developers won't bother.

Now, let's see what this code looks like using the `class` keyword.

#### 1.5.3 Class Declarations

The simplest way to create classes in JavaScript is with the **class declaration**, which looks similar to classes in other languages.

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(length, width) { // `constructor` is a method named constructor inside the class
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  } // no commas between the properties of the class

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.width;
  }
}

let rec = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(typeof Rectangle); // function
console.log(rec instanceof Rectangle); // true
console.log(rec.constructor); // [class Rectangle]
console.log(rec.getArea()); // 50
```

Class declarations begin with the `class` keyword, followed by the name of the class. The rest of the syntax looks similar to the simplified (concise) method definition that you can use in object literals. However, there are *no commas between the properties of the class*.

One significant difference is that the `constructor` is now a method named constructor inside our class instead of being a standalone function. Other methods have no special meaning; you can define as many as you need. In this case, we define `getArea`, and it gets placed in `Rectangle.prototype`.

In most situations, instantiating a new object from a class is identical to creating one with the constructor/prototype pattern:

```js
let rec = new Rectangle(10, 5);
```

You can even call methods on `Rectangle.prototype` in the same way:

```js
console.log(rec.getArea());
```

The class code and instantiation is so similar to the constructor/prototype code that `typeof` even returns `'function'`, and the object checks out as an instance of `Rectangle`:

```js
console.log(typeof Rectangle); // "function"
console.log(rec instanceof Rectangle); // true
```

One minor difference is that `rec.constructor` may produce different results in the two patterns. For example, in Node, logging `rec.constructor` produces `[Function: Rectangle]` for the constructor/prototype example, and `[class Rectangle]` for the class example. This difference is implementation dependent, and not considered significant.

There is one significant difference, however: you ***must*** use the `new` keyword to call the constructor when using a `class`. JavaScript raises a `TypeError` if you try to call the constructor without the `new` keyword.

Using classes, *it's possible to do everything you can with the constructor and prototype pattern*. However, the class syntax is easier to read and write, and the enforced `new` keyword helps prevent bugs.

#### 1.5.4 Class Expressions

Functions have an *expression* form that does not require a name after the function keyword. Classes have a similar expression form. Consider the following code:

```js
let Rectangle = class { // class expression
  constructor(length, width) {
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.width;
  }
};
```

Aside from the syntax, class expressions are functionally equivalent to class declarations. Which you use is primarily a matter of style.

#### 1.5.5 Classes as First-Class Citizens

In programming, a **first-class citizen** is a value that can be passed into a function, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable. Like JavaScript functions, JavaScript classes are also first-class values. For example, you can *pass classes into functions as arguments*:

```js
function createObject(classDef) {
  return new classDef();
}

class Foo {
  sayHi() {
    console.log('Hi');
  }
}

let obj = createObject(Foo);
obj.sayHi(); // => logs 'Hi!'
```

If that doesn't surprise you, that's good! Earlier, we mentioned that classes are just functions, and demonstrated that with `typeof`:

```js
typeof Foo; // => "function"
```

Since functions are first-class objects, classes must also be first-class objects!

#### 1.5.6 Static Methods and Properties

You may remember seeing some methods like `Array.isArray` and `Object.keys` that are invoked with Array or Object as the caller instead of an actual array or object. For instance:

```js
Array.isArray([1, 2, 3]); // => true
[1, 2, 3].isArray();      // raises a TypeError
```

Methods like these are defined on the constructor for the type, e.g., `Array` or `Object`. You may sometimes hear such methods described as class methods. However, in JavaScript, that's a bit of a misnomer. Instead, you should call such methods **static methods**.

Ordinary methods -- those defined on a prototype object -- are sometimes called **instance methods** or **object methods** since you need an instance of (an object) the type. More commonly, they are simply called methods.

You can define static methods on your custom constructor methods. For instance, let's add one to the `Rectangle` type we defined earlier:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length = length;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.getDescription = function() {
  return 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
}

console.log(Rectangle.getDescription()); // A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides
```

This code defines a static method named `getDescription` on the `Rectangle` constructor. To use this method, you invoke it with the `Rectangle` function object.

It should come as no surprise that you can define static methods with the `class` keyword as well: just use the static keyword:

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(length, width) {
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  }

  static getDescription() {
    return 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.length * this.width;
  }
}

console.log(Rectangle.getDescription()); // A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides
```

As before, we call the method with the name of the constructor function -- in the case of a class, the constructor function's name is the name of the class.

You can also define static properties. Static properties are properties that are defined on the constructor function instead of the individual objects. One well-known example of a static property is the `length` property used by the `String` type. To define a static property with the constructor and prototype pattern, just add it to the constructor function object:

```js
Rectangle.description = 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
```

To do the same thing with a `class`, just use the `static` keyword inside the `class`:

```js
class Rectangle {
  static description = 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
}
```

As of this writing in late 2020, static properties are a recent addition to JavaScript. They aren't completely supported, yet. Fortunately, recent versions of Node support them, which means we can use them in our code in this course. If you want to use static properties in a browser or an older version of Node that doesn't support them, you can accomplish the same effect by adding a property directly to the class:

```js
Rectangle.description = 'A rectangle is a shape with 4 sides';
```

Yes, that code is identical to what we would write if we were using the constructor/prototype pattern.

#### 1.5.7 Another Example - ES6 Class (Pseudo-classical inheritance)

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, length) {
    this.width = width;
    this.length = length;
  }

  getWidth() {
    return this.width;
  }

  getLength() {
    return this.length;
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.width * this.length;
  }
}

let rect = new Rectangle(4, 5);

console.log(rect.getWidth()); // 4
console.log(rect.getLength()); // 5
console.log(rect.getArea()); // 20
```

In the constructor function we are creating two properties `width` and `length` and assigning to them values of parameters with the same name. To access the value of each property within methods, we use the `this` keyword in front of each property name.

## 2. Methods and Properties; Instance and Static Methods and Properties

In OOP, we often refer to individual objects of a specific data type as **instances** of that type. For example, in the `Dog` example from the [Constructors with Prototypes assignment](https://launchschool.com/lessons/e3c64e3f/assignments/bdc27fe0), `maxi` and `dexter` are instances of the `Dog` type. An instance is just another term for the objects created using any means of defining multiple objects of the same kind (e.g., dogs). The term **object** is more general, while **instance** is more specific.

So far, we've been using constructors to create instances of the `Dog` type. We can also think of objects created by factory functions as instances. Later, we'll see even more ways to create new objects, all of which can be called instances.

Hold on there. Factory functions can create instances? How can that be? There's no way to tell that the objects created by, say, a `createDog` factory are indeed dogs, so how can we have instances?

That's a good point. However, in the end, we know that the `createDog` factory is going to create a bunch of objects that we know to represent dogs. We may not be able to tell whether an arbitrary object is a dog object, but all of the objects created by `createDog` should be dogs. They have a type -- dog -- even if there is no way to test that in your code. Thus, they are instances of a dog type.

[Common Object Methods](https://elainevuongyt.notion.site/Common-Object-Methods-7d3ed006cfe641508635a40c7ec6f5e4)

### 2.1 Instance Properties

It's convenient to describe the properties of an instance as **instance properties**. These properties belong to a specific instance of some type. Thus, in our `Dog` example from the earlier assignment, we say that the `name`, `breed`, and `weight` properties are all instance properties of the various instances of the `Dog` type. If we want to access the weight for `Maxi` from the above example, we must use the `maxi` object:

```js
maxi.weight; // 32
```

If we try to use the constructor, instead, it won't work:

```js
Dog.weight; // undefined
```

This code returns `undefined` since `weight` isn't a property of the constructor; it's a property of the instances created by that constructor. It also doesn't make sense to define it on the constructor function: weight is a property of an individual dog, not one that is related to dogs as a type.

### 2.2 Instance Methods

Since methods are also properties on an object, we can refer to methods stored directly in an object as instance properties too. More commonly, we call them **instance methods** just to distinguish them from ordinary data properties.

However, methods usually aren't stored directly in instances. Instead, they are usually defined in the object's prototype object. While methods defined in the prototype object aren't stored in the instance object, they still operate on individual instances. Therefore, we usually refer to them as instance methods. In our `Dog` example, `bark` is an instance method since it's defined on the `Dog.prototype` object.

As with `weight`, we must use an object created by the `Dog` constructor to invoke `bark`:

```js
maxi.bark(); // Woof!
```

Again, we can't use the constructor to call this method:

```js
Dog.bark(); // TypeError: Dog.bark is not a function
```

In this specific example, we can call `Dog.prototype.bark()`, but that doesn't always work well. For instance, calling `Dog.prototype.bark()` won't recognize the fact that `dexter` has a different version of `bark`.

Any method defined in any prototype in the prototype chain of an object is considered to be an instance method of the object.

### 2.3 Static Properties

**Static properties** are defined and accessed directly on the constructor, not on an instance or a prototype. Typically, static properties belong to the type (e.g., `Dog`) rather than to the individual instances or the prototype object.

For instance, dogs belong to the species "Canis lupus". That property of dogs doesn't have anything to do with individual dogs; it's information that is pertinent about all dogs. Therefore, it makes sense to add this property directly to the `Dog` constructor as a static property:

```js
Dog.species = "Canis lupus";
```

Now, when our application needs to know the species that dogs belong to, we can access it from the constructor directly:

```js
console.log(`Dogs belong to the species ${Dog.species}`);
```

One common use of static properties is to keep track of all of the objects created by a constructor. For instance:

```js
function Dog(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;
  Dog.allDogs.push(this);
}

Dog.allDogs = [];
```

In this case, the static property `allDogs` contains an array with a reference to every dog object created while the program is running. While `allDogs` maintains a list of all the dogs, it isn't information that is pertinent to a specific dog -- it's information about dogs in general. Therefore, it should be a static property.

### 2.4 Static Methods

Static properties don't have to be ordinary data properties. You can also define static methods:

```js
Dog.showSpecies = function() {
  console.log(`Dogs belong to the species ${Dog.species}`);
};

Dog.showSpecies();
```

You've already seen examples of static methods on built-in JavaScript constructors.`Object.assign`, `Array.isArray`, and `Date.now` are all examples of static methods.

## 3. Prototypal and Pseudo-classical Inheritance

JavaScript objects can *inherit properties from other objects*. The object that another object inherits properties from is its **prototype**. In most cases, we use `Object.create` to create objects whose prototype we need to *set explicitly*. We can also use `Object.setPrototypeOf` to *set the prototype of an object that already exists*.

By default, all object literals inherit from `Object.prototype`.

When you access a property on an object, JavaScript looks for the property first in the object, then its prototype chain, all the way up to `Object.prototype`.

1. Every object has an internal `[[Prototype]]` property that points to a special object, the object's prototype. It is used to look up properties that don't exist on the object itself.

  1.1 `Object.create` returns a new object with the passed-in argument as its prototype.
  1.2 You can use `Object.getPrototypeOf` and `obj.isPrototypeOf` to check for prototype relationships between objects.

2. Looking up a property in the prototype chain is the basis for prototypal inheritance, or property sharing through the prototype chain. Objects lower down in the chain inherit properties and behaviors from objects in the chain above. That is, downstream objects can delegate properties or behaviors to upstream objects.

  2.1 A downstream object overrides an inherited property if it has a property with the same name. (Overriding is similar to shadowing, but it doesn't completely hide the overridden properties.)
  2.2 `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` and `obj.hasOwnProperty` can be used to test whether an object owns a given property.

The pseudo-classical inheritance pattern has types (e.g., classes) that inherit from other types. This way, all objects of a given type can share behaviors from the same source.

### 3.1 Prototypes

In JavaScript, objects can *inherit properties and behavior from other objects*. If another object, for instance, has a `language` property and a `speak` behavior, a new object can access and use `language` and `speak` without explicitly defining them in the new object.

More specifically, JavaScript objects use something called **prototypal inheritance**. The object that you inherit properties and methods from is called the **prototype**. The function `Object.create` creates a new object that inherits properties from an existing object. It takes an object that is called the prototype object as an argument, and returns a new object that inherits properties from the prototype object. The newly created object has access to all the properties and methods that the prototype object provides.

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
};

let b = Object.create(a);
b.foo; // => 1
```

An unusual aspect of this relationship is that the **inheriting object** (`b` above) doesn't receive any properties or methods of its own. Instead, it **delegates** property and method access to its prototype. You can see this in the node console:

```sh
> let a = { foo: 1, bar: 2 }
undefined

> let b = Object.create(a)
undefined

> b.foo
1

> b
{}
```

Evaluating `b` in the node console gives us an empty object, which demonstrates that `b` doesn't have any properties of its own. We can also use the `hasOwnProperty` method to demonstrate this:

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
};

let b = Object.create(a);

console.log(a.hasOwnProperty('foo')); // => true
console.log(b.hasOwnProperty('foo')); // => false
```

The `hasOwnProperty` method is available on all JavaScript objects. It takes the name of a property as a string and returns `true` if the object has a property by that name, `false` if it does not.

JavaScript objects use an internal `[[Prototype]]` property to keep track of their prototype. When you create an object with `Object.create()`, the new object's `[[Prototype]]` property gets assigned to the prototype object.

Note that `[[Prototype]]` is an **internal** property: you cannot access it directly in your code. However, you can access and replace its value with `Object` functions. For instance, `Object.getPrototypeOf()` takes an object as an argument and returns its prototype object:

```js
> Object.getPrototypeOf(b)
{ foo: 1, bar: 2}
```

You can use `Object.setPrototypeOf()` to set the prototype object of an object:

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
},

let b = {}; // line 6
Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a);

console.log(b.foo); // => 1
console.log(b); // => {}
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(b)); // { foo: 1, bar: 2}
```

The code on lines 6 and 7 is effectively identical to the code that we used on line 6 of the `Object.create` example. However, in this example, we declare and initialize `b` to an empty object rather than using `Object.create`; we then use `Object.setPrototypeOf` to set the prototype object.

An important consideration when dealing with prototypes is that objects hold a reference to their prototype objects through their internal `[[Prototype]]` property. If the object's prototype changes in some way, the changes are *observable in the inheriting object as well*.

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
};

let b = {};
Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a);
console.log(b.foo) // => 1

a.foo = 42;
console.log(b.foo); // => 42

// adds key 'baz' with value 12
a.baz = 12;
console.log(b.baz); // => 12
```

### 3.2 The Default Prototype

As mentioned above, all JavaScript objects have access to the `hasOwnProperty()` method. Where does JavaScript get that method? When we create a new object, we don't have to add our own `hasOwnProperty()` method. Instead, JavaScript obtains the method from the object's prototype. All JavaScript objects inherit from a prototype. For instance:

```sh
> let a = {}
undefined

> Object.getPrototypeOf(a)
{}
```

Passing an empty object to `Object.getPrototypeOf()` returns a default prototype object. That object is the **prototype** for all objects created by using the object literal syntax (e.g., `{ a: 2 }`). The default prototype is the prototype object of the `Object` constructor, `Object.prototype`. We'll see what that means a little later. For now, all you need to know is that Object.prototype provides the default prototype.

### 3.3 Iterating Over Objects with Prototypes

Now is an excellent time to revisit the [Iteration](https://launchschool.com/books/javascript/read/objects#iteration) section from the Objects chapter of our Introduction to Programming With JavaScript book. It discusses the impact of object prototypes on iteration. In particular:

- A `for/in` loop iterates over an object's properties. The iteration includes properties from the objects in its prototype chain. Use `hasOwnProperty()` to skip the prototype properties.

- `Object.keys()` returns an object's "own" property keys -- you do not need to use `hasOwnProperty()`.

Note that both `for/in` and `Object.keys()` deal with **enumerable properties**, which is merely a way of talking about properties you can iterate over. Not all properties are enumerable. In particular, most properties and methods of the built-in types are not. Usually, any properties or methods you define for an object are enumerable. You can check whether a property is enumerable with the `Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable()` method.

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr.propertyIsEnumerable('length'));                     // false
console.log(arr.propertyIsEnumerable('2'));                          // true
console.log(arr.propertyIsEnumerable('forEach'));                    // false
console.log(Array.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable('forEach'));        // false

function Foo() {
  this.bar = "qux"
}

Foo.prototype.baz = function() {};
let foo = new Foo();
console.log(foo.propertyIsEnumerable('bar'));                        // true
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(foo).propertyIsEnumerable('baz')); // true
```

You do not have to remember how to use `propertyIsEnumerable`.

### 3.4 The Prototype Chain

Earlier, we said that all JavaScript objects could inherit from another object using the prototype model. Since the prototype of an object is itself an object, the prototype can also have a prototype from which it inherits. For example:

```js
let a = {
  foo: 1,
};

let b = {
  bar: 2,
};

let c = {
  baz: 3,
};

Object.setPrototypeOf(c, b);
Object.setPrototypeOf(b, a);

console.log(c.bar); // => 2
console.log(c.foo); // => 1
```

In this code, object `c` inherits from object `b` which, in turn, inherits from `a`. Stated differently, `b` is the prototype of `c` and `a` is the prototype of `b`. All properties that you can access on `a` or `b` are now available on `c`. We say that objects `b` and `a` are part of the **prototype chain** of object `c`. The complete prototype chain also includes the default prototype, which is the prototype of object `a` in this case. Since the prototype of `Object.prototype` is `null`, the complete prototype chain looks like this:

```sh
c --> b --> a --> Object.prototype --> null
```

### 3.5 The `__proto__` Property

Many older JavaScript programs use a property named `__proto__`, which is pronounced **dunder proto**, instead of `Object.setPrototypeOf` and `Object.getPrototypeOf`. "dunder" is a shortened version of "double underscore", which alludes to the double underscores at the beginning and end of the name. The `__proto__` property is a *deprecated*, non-hidden version of the `[[Prototype]]` property. As a rule, you should only use `__proto__` if you need to support very old browsers or old versions of Node, or as a convenient shortcut with temporary code or debugging operations. You may run into code that uses it, so you need to at least be aware of it.

### 3.6 Prototypal Inheritance vs Pseudo-classical Inheritance

As used in JavaScript, the term **inheritance** is an *overloaded word*. It describes two related but distinct forms of inheritance: **prototypal** and **pseudo-classical**.

The *simpler form of inheritance* is **prototypal inheritance** or **prototypal delegation**. We sometimes call this form of inheritance **object inheritance** since it works with one object at a time. An object's internal `[[Prototype]]` property points to another object, and the object can delegate method calls to that other object. We've seen plenty of examples of prototypal inheritance in earlier assignments. For instance:

```js
let humanPrototype = {
  myName() { return this.name; },
  myAge() { return this.age; },
};

let personPrototype = Object.create(humanPrototype);
personPrototype.toString = function() {
  return `My name is ${this.myName()} and I'm ${this.myAge()} years old.`;
};

let will = Object.create(personPrototype);
will.name = 'William';
will.age = 28;
will.toString(); // => My name is William and I'm 28 years old.
```

Here, the `will` object inherits from the `personPrototype` object which, in turn, inherits from `humanPrototype`. `will`'s `[[Prototype]]` property refers to `personPrototype`, and the `[[Prototype]]` property of `personPrototype` refers to `humanPrototype`. When we invoke `toString`, it finds the methods `myName` and `myAge` on the `humanPrototype` object.

In this assignment, we've been using an object creation pattern called **pseudo-classical** object construction, also known as the **constructor/prototype pattern**. In this pattern, we use a constructor function and a prototype object to create objects and provide common methods for those objects. For instance:

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `My name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`;
}
```

The term "pseudo-classical" refers to the fact that *the pattern mimics classes from other OO languages but doesn't actually use classes*.

This pattern forms the basis of **pseudo-classical inheritance**, also called **constructor inheritance**. When people talk about inheritance in the context of JavaScript, they often mean this kind of inheritance. In pseudo-classical inheritance, a constructor's prototype object (the object referenced by its `prototype` property) inherits from another constructor's prototype. That is, *a sub-type inherits from a super-type*.

For instance, we can *rewrite* the **prototypal inheritance** example to use **pseudo-classical inheritance**:

```js
function Human() {}
Human.prototype.myName = function() { return this.name; };
Human.prototype.myAge = function() { return this.age; };

function Person() {}
Person.prototype = Object.create(Human.prototype);
Person.prototype.constructor = Person;
Person.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `My name is ${this.myName()} and I'm ${this.myAge()} years old.`;
};

let will = new Person();
will.name = 'William';
will.age = 28;
will.toString(); // My name is William and I'm 28 years old.
```

Note that using `class` and the `extends` keyword is an alternative form of pseudo-classical inheritance. We'll meet the `extends` keyword a little later. So you'll recognize it later, here's what **pseudo-classical inheritance** looks like with `class` and `extends`:

```js
class Human {
  myName() { return this.name; }
  myAge() { return this.age; }
}

class Person extends Human {
  toString() {
    return `My name is ${this.myName()} and I'm ${this.myAge()} years old.`;
  }
}

let will = new Person();
will.name = 'William';
will.age = 28;
will.toString(); // => My name is William and I'm 28 years old.
```

Both pseudo-classical and prototypal inheritance *use prototypal delegation under the hood*. If the requested property isn't found, the object delegates the request to the object's prototype object. If the requested property isn't there either, the prototype object delegates the request to its own prototype object. This process follows the prototype chain until the property or method is found or the end of the prototype chain is found.

RR


## Extracted NOTES

As useful as factory functions are, *there are other ways to extract code into one place so that multiple objects can use it*. In JavaScript, we rely heavily on **prototypes** to accomplish this.

One object factory can *reuse another object* factory by mixing the object returned by another factory function into itself by using `Object.assign()`.

Unlike other mainstream languages, JavaScript doesn't implement behavior sharing using class-based inheritance even though ES6 introduced the class keyword to the language. Instead, it *uses the object prototype to share properties*.

JavaScript defines undeclared variables as properties of the global object. Such properties act like global variables though -- you can access them from anywhere in your program.

Object property names are not variables.

`Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf()`

The `isPrototypeOf(object)` method checks if an object exists in another object's prototype chain.

```js
function Foo() {}
function Bar() {}
function Baz() {}

Bar.prototype = Object.create(Foo.prototype);
Baz.prototype = Object.create(Bar.prototype);

const foo = new Foo();
const bar = new Bar();
const baz = new Baz();

// prototype chains:
// foo: Foo <- Object
// bar: Bar <- Foo <- Object
// baz: Baz <- Bar <- Foo <- Object

console.log(Baz.prototype.isPrototypeOf(baz));    // true
console.log(Baz.prototype.isPrototypeOf(bar));    // false
console.log(Baz.prototype.isPrototypeOf(foo));    // false
console.log(Bar.prototype.isPrototypeOf(baz));    // true
console.log(Bar.prototype.isPrototypeOf(foo));    // false
console.log(Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf(baz));    // true
console.log(Foo.prototype.isPrototypeOf(bar));    // true
console.log(Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(baz)); // true
```
