# Lesson 5: More Objected Oriented Programming

## Assignment 1: Introduction

We're now ready to tackle some more extensive programs using the OO concepts that we covered in previous lessons. The projects in this lesson are going to seem extremely difficult since we're putting a great deal of knowledge to work. We must also think about various OO design tradeoffs that don't have a single correct answer.

If you find that you're struggling, type along and let the material sink in. It takes time and repetition for this material to make sense. In particular, don't worry if OO-design issues push you beyond your comfort zone. Instead, digest as much as you can, then repeat the lesson until you feel reasonably comfortable. However, don't expect to master the design aspects; that requires many years of professional experience. This lesson won't try to make you an expert on OO design. Instead, it should give you a small taste of those topics.

## Assignment 2: OO Tic Tac Toe Overview

In this and the next few assignments, we'll build a Tic Tac Toe game similar to the one we built in a prior course. This game is more complicated than Rock, Paper, Scissors since we must deal with the notion of a ***game state*** that represents the current state of the board. The RPS game doesn't have a game state, only choices.

We'll take an object-oriented approach to design our game, so we'll employ the steps we learned earlier:

1. Write a textual description of the problem or exercise.
2. Extract the significant nouns and verbs from the description.
3. Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns.

### 2.1 Description

Let's begin by writing a textual description of the game.

- Tic Tac Toe is a 2-player board game.
- The board is a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking a square with a marker that identifies the player.
- Traditionally, the player to go first uses the marker `X` to mark her squares, and the player to go second uses the marker `O`.
- The first player to mark 3 squares in a row with her marker wins the game.
- A row can be a horizontal row, a vertical column, or either of the two diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left).
- There is one human player and one computer player.
- The human player always moves (places a marker) first in the initial version of our game; you can change that later.

This description provides a little more detail than the one we used in the earlier course, but it's effectively the same.

### 2.2 Identify the Nouns and Verbs

On the surface, Tic Tac Toe is a straightforward and simple game. There aren't many nouns and verbs:

Nouns  | game, board, square, grid, marker, row, player, human, computer
-------|----------------------------------------------------------------
Verbs  | play, mark, move, place
