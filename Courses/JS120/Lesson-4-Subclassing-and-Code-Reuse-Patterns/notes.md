# Lesson 4: Subclassing and Code Reuse Patterns

## Assignment 1. Introduction

So far in this course, we've discussed a number of different concepts which underpin the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. We've also explored various different ways in which these concepts are implemented in the context of a JavaScript program.

By this point you should be comfortable with the concept of using objects to *encapsulate* data and behavior in order to add structure to your code, and the importance of **function execution context** when working with objects in this way. You should have an understanding of using prototypes to delegate property and method access. You should also be familiar with using object creation patterns in order to create multiple objects of the same **type**.

The advantages of using an object-oriented approach really start to become apparent when you combine some of these concepts together. In this lesson, we'll explore how you can leverage prototypal delegation to create object **subtypes**. This is one way of enabling code re-use within your programs. Another way of enabling code re-use is by using **mix-ins**, we'll look at how to do that too. Finally, we'll tie these ideas together by discussing another of the fundamental pillars of OOP: **polymorphism**.

As well as this, we'll demonstrate the flexibility of object-orientation in JavaScript by exploring another object creation pattern, the OLOO pattern.

## Assignment 2. Object Creation with Prototypes (OLOO)

### 2.1 Review of Factory Function

In a prior lesson, we showed an example of an object creation pattern called the **factory function**. We'll revisit that example and use it to illustrate another object creation pattern that uses prototypes. Here's the code that we saw earlier:

```js
function createCar(make, model, year) {
  return {
    make,
    model,
    year,
    started: false,

    start() {
      this.started = true;
    }

    stop() {
      this.started = false;
    },
  };
}
```

The `createCar` function takes three arguments and returns a car object with four properties and two methods. We can use it like this:

```js
let car1 = createCar('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
let car2 = createCar('Honda', 'Civic', 2017);
```

### 2.2 The OLOO Pattern

As discussed earlier factory functions aren't the only way to create objects in bulk. Another pattern that we can use is the **OLOO** pattern: **Objects Linking to Other Objects**. It uses prototypes and involves extracting properties common to all objects of the same type (e.g., car objects) to a prototype object. All objects of the same type the inherit from the prototype.

Let's do that with car objects. What properties are common to all car objects? Here, those properties are the `start` and `stop` methods. All cars have `make`, `model`, `year`, and `started` properties as well, but each object has different values for those properties. Thus, we don't count them as being common to all cars.

We can extract the `start` and `stop` methods to a prototype object.

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },
};
```

Now that we have a car prototype object, all car objects can inherit from it:

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.make = 'Toyota';
car1.model = 'Corolla';
car1.year = 2016;
```

We can now call `start` and `stop` on the `car1` object since both are accessible through it prototype, `carPrototype`.

```js
car1.start();
car1.started; // => true

car1.stop();
car1.started; // => false
```

Calling `start` and `stop` on the `car1` object changes the state of `car1` even though those methods don't belong to `car1`. That shouldn't come as a surprise since we're using `car1` as the execution context for the calls. When we call these methods, `this` is set to `car1`, so the methods change the `started` property in `car1`.

That's all well and good. We've set up a car prototype that all our car objects can inherit. However, we still have a small problem: *we must set the `make`, `model`, and `year` properties manually every time we create a car object*. Can we automate that? Fortunately, yes; there's more than one way. The most common technique uses an `init` method on the prototype object:

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },

  init(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  },
};
```

We can then use it like so:

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.init('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
```

This code is certainly better, but we still need two lines of code to create a new car object. A small improvement to our `init` method can change that as well:

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },

  init(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    return this; // <-- small improvement to the `init` method
  },
};
```

Since `init` now returns a reference to the car object it was called on, we can chain `create` and `init` and assign the result to the `car1` variable.

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype).init('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
```

### 2.3 Advantage of OLOO over Factory Function

You can use both factory functions and the OLOO pattern to bulk create objects of the same type. Though the result is an object creation mechanism in both cases, the OLOO pattern has one significant advantage over factory functions: **memory efficiency**. Since all objects created with the OLOO pattern *inherit methods from a single prototype object*, the objects that inherit from that prototype object share the same methods. Factory functions, on the other hand, create copies of all the methods for each new object. That can have a significant performance impact, especially on smaller devices with limited memory.

However, that doesn't mean that OLOO is decidedly better than the factory pattern. An advantage of the factory pattern is that it lets us *create objects with private state*. If that doesn't make sense to you yet, don't worry. We'll return to this topic in a later course when we discuss **closures**.
