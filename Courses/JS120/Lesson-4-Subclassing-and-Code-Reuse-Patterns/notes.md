# Lesson 4: Subclassing and Code Reuse Patterns

## Assignment 1. Introduction

So far in this course, we've discussed a number of different concepts which underpin the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. We've also explored various different ways in which these concepts are implemented in the context of a JavaScript program.

By this point you should be comfortable with the concept of using objects to *encapsulate* data and behavior in order to add structure to your code, and the importance of **function execution context** when working with objects in this way. You should have an understanding of using prototypes to delegate property and method access. You should also be familiar with using object creation patterns in order to create multiple objects of the same **type**.

The advantages of using an object-oriented approach really start to become apparent when you combine some of these concepts together. In this lesson, we'll explore how you can leverage prototypal delegation to create object **subtypes**. This is one way of enabling code re-use within your programs. Another way of enabling code re-use is by using **mix-ins**, we'll look at how to do that too. Finally, we'll tie these ideas together by discussing another of the fundamental pillars of OOP: **polymorphism**.

As well as this, we'll demonstrate the flexibility of object-orientation in JavaScript by exploring another object creation pattern, the OLOO pattern.

## Assignment 2. Object Creation with Prototypes (OLOO)

### 2.1 Review of Factory Function

In a prior lesson, we showed an example of an object creation pattern called the **factory function**. We'll revisit that example and use it to illustrate another object creation pattern that uses prototypes. Here's the code that we saw earlier:

```js
function createCar(make, model, year) {
  return {
    make,
    model,
    year,
    started: false,

    start() {
      this.started = true;
    }

    stop() {
      this.started = false;
    },
  };
}
```

The `createCar` function takes three arguments and returns a car object with four properties and two methods. We can use it like this:

```js
let car1 = createCar('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
let car2 = createCar('Honda', 'Civic', 2017);
```

### 2.2 The OLOO Pattern

As discussed earlier factory functions aren't the only way to create objects in bulk. Another pattern that we can use is the **OLOO** pattern: **Objects Linking to Other Objects**. It uses prototypes and involves extracting properties common to all objects of the same type (e.g., car objects) to a prototype object. All objects of the same type the inherit from the prototype.

Let's do that with car objects. What properties are common to all car objects? Here, those properties are the `start` and `stop` methods. All cars have `make`, `model`, `year`, and `started` properties as well, but each object has different values for those properties. Thus, we don't count them as being common to all cars.

We can extract the `start` and `stop` methods to a prototype object.

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },
};
```

Now that we have a car prototype object, all car objects can inherit from it:

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.make = 'Toyota';
car1.model = 'Corolla';
car1.year = 2016;
```

We can now call `start` and `stop` on the `car1` object since both are accessible through it prototype, `carPrototype`.

```js
car1.start();
car1.started; // => true

car1.stop();
car1.started; // => false
```

Calling `start` and `stop` on the `car1` object changes the state of `car1` even though those methods don't belong to `car1`. That shouldn't come as a surprise since we're using `car1` as the execution context for the calls. When we call these methods, `this` is set to `car1`, so the methods change the `started` property in `car1`.

That's all well and good. We've set up a car prototype that all our car objects can inherit. However, we still have a small problem: *we must set the `make`, `model`, and `year` properties manually every time we create a car object*. Can we automate that? Fortunately, yes; there's more than one way. The most common technique uses an `init` method on the prototype object:

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },

  init(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  },
};
```

We can then use it like so:

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype);
car1.init('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
```

This code is certainly better, but we still need two lines of code to create a new car object. A small improvement to our `init` method can change that as well:

```js
let carPrototype = {
  start: function() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop: function() {
    this.started = false;
  },

  init(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    return this; // <-- small improvement to the `init` method
  },
};
```

Since `init` now returns a reference to the car object it was called on, we can chain `create` and `init` and assign the result to the `car1` variable.

```js
let car1 = Object.create(carPrototype).init('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
```

### 2.3 Advantage of OLOO over Factory Function

You can use both factory functions and the OLOO pattern to bulk create objects of the same type. Though the result is an object creation mechanism in both cases, the OLOO pattern has one significant advantage over factory functions: **memory efficiency**. Since all objects created with the OLOO pattern *inherit methods from a single prototype object*, the objects that inherit from that prototype object share the same methods. Factory functions, on the other hand, create copies of all the methods for each new object. That can have a significant performance impact, especially on smaller devices with limited memory.

However, that doesn't mean that OLOO is decidedly better than the factory pattern. An advantage of the factory pattern is that it lets us *create objects with private state*. If that doesn't make sense to you yet, don't worry. We'll return to this topic in a later course when we discuss **closures**.

## Assignment 3. Practice Problems: Object Creation with Prototypes

### 3.1 Use a factory function to create pet objects. The factory should let us create and use pets like this:

```js
function createPet(animal, name) {
  return {
    animal: animal, // animal,
    name: name, // name,

    sleep: function() { // sleep()
      console.log("I am sleeping");
    },

    wake: function() { // wake()
      console.log("I am awake");
    },
  };
}

let pudding = createPet("Cat", "Pudding");
console.log(`I am a ${pudding.animal}. My name is ${pudding.name}.`);
pudding.sleep(); // I am sleeping
pudding.wake(); // I am awake

let neptune = createPet("Fish", "Neptune");
console.log(`I am a ${neptune.animal}. My name is ${neptune.name}`);
neptune.sleep(); // I am sleeping
neptune.wake(); // I am awake
```

### 3.2 Use the OLOO pattern to create an object prototype that we can use to create pet objects. The prototype should let us create and use pets like this:

```js
const PetPrototype = {
  init(animal, name) {
    this.animal = animal;
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  },

  sleep: function() {
    console.log("I am sleeping");
  },

  wake: function() {
    console.log("I am awake");
  },
};

let pudding = Object.create(PetPrototype).init("Cat", "Pudding");
console.log(`I am a ${pudding.animal}. My name is ${pudding.name}`);
pudding.sleep(); // I am sleeping
pudding.wake(); // I am awake

let neptune = Object.create(PetPrototype).init("Fish", "Neptune");
console.log(`I am a ${neptune.animal}. My name is ${neptune.name}.`);
neptune.sleep(); // I am sleeping
neptune.wake();  // I am awake
```

### 3.3 Consider the objects created by the programs in problems 1 and 2. How do objects for the same animal differ from each other?

Objects created with the OLOO have a prototype object that contains the methods associated with the created objects. Since all pets created from the prototype share a single prototype object, they all share the same methods. With the factory function, each object has a copy of all the methods. Thus, objects created by OLOO are more efficient in terms of memory use.

Objects created with the factory function can have private state. Any state stored in the body of the factory function instead of in the returned object is private to the returned object. They can't be accessed or modified unless one of the object methods exposes the state. With OLOO, there is no way to define private state. All object state can be accessed and modified by outside code.

## Assignment 4. Subtyping with Constructors and Prototypes

### 4.1 Introduction

In an earlier lesson, we learned how to use constructors together with prototypes to create objects of the same type. The combination of constructors and prototypes gives us something that resembles a **class**, a construct used in classical OOP languages like Java, Python, and Ruby. A *class is a blueprint for creating objects*. Traditional OOP languages use classes to create distinct objects of a particular type and give those objects the behaviors and state that they need.

Constructors and prototypes let us mimic classes in JavaScript. Until recently, the language had nothing that you could reasonably call a class. That made it hard for developers familiar with class-based languages to switch to JavaScript. One can even argue that constructors and prototypes are part of the language solely to make it easier for developers to switch to JavaScript.

An essential part of the OO paradigm is the concept of inheritance. In most OOP languages, inheritance means something a bit different from the way we use it in conjunction with JavaScript. That can make JavaScript inheritance confusing if you've seen inheritance in other languages. For now, it may be wise to forget what you think you know about inheritance based on those other languages.

Let's look at an example that shows why we might need inheritance in an application. Assume that we have a drawing application that lets the user work with shapes. In this app, the constructor/prototype combination for rectangles might look like this:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
  this.length;
  this.width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

Rectangle.prototype.toString() = function() {
  return `[Rectangle ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
}
```

We can create and manipulate `Rectangle` objects like so:

```js
let rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
rect.getArea(); // => 50
rect.toString(); // '[Rectangle 10 x 5]'
```

Our `Rectangle` constructor creates rectangle objects that have `width` and `length` as properties and the methods `getArea` and `toString`.

Suppose our application also needs squares. We can set up another constructor/prototype combination for those squares, and then follow the same pattern we used for rectangles:

```js
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype.getArea = function() {
  return this.length * this.width;
};

Square.prototype.toString = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
};

let sqr = new Square(5);
sqr.getArea();     // => 25
sqr.toString();    // => "[Square 5 x 5]"
```

There's some code duplication between this code and the `Rectangle` code. In particular, `Square.prototype.getArea` and `Rectangle.prototype.getArea` are identical. That gives us a chance to reuse some code.

We can *use prototypal inheritance to our advantage here*. One way to think about the relationship between `Square` and `Rectangle` is that a square is a special kind of rectangle where both the length and width are the same. We say that `Square` is a **sub-type** of `Rectangle`, or that `Rectangle` is a **super-type** of `Square`. Consider the following code:

```js
function Square(size) {
  this.length = size;
  this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype);

Square.prototype.toString() = function() {
  return `[Square ${this.length} x ${this.width}]`;
};

let sqr = new Square(5);
sqr.getArea(); // => 25
sqr.toString(); // "[Square 5 x 5]"
```

Since a function's `prototype` property is writable -- we can change what object it references -- we can reassign `Square.prototype` to an object that inherits from `Rectangle.prototype`. The result is a prototype chain that looks like this:

```js
sqr ---> Square.prototype ---> Rectangle.prototype ---> Object.prototype
```

All objects created by the `Square` constructor inherit from `Square.prototype`, which we have set up to inherit from `Rectangle.prototype`. Thus, all square objects have access to methods on `Rectangle.prototype`. Since `toString` must be different for squares, we override it in `Square.prototype`. That is, we customize `Square.prototype.toString`. Since `getArea` *requires no customization*, we can let square objects use the inherited `Rectangle.prototype.getArea`.
