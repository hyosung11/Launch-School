# Lesson 2: Functions, Objects, and Prototypes

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to lesson 2 of JS120! In this lesson, we'll talk about how functions and objects work together. Specifically, we'll discuss two major topics: **execution context** and **object prototypes**.

It's crucial to understand how the execution context, i.e., the value of this, is determined and what it refers to in various scenarios. Understanding this is one of the most challenging aspects of JavaScript. It's also one of the most important. Many errors and bugs in JavaScript programs result from a poor understanding of the execution context. It's imperative, therefore, that you **pay extra attention to this lesson** and go through it several times to solidify your mental model.

A cornerstone of object-oriented JavaScript is the concept of object prototypes. In fact, it is the sole mechanism with which JavaScript implements object oriented programming. This is a very important topic, which we'll get an introduction to in this lesson.
