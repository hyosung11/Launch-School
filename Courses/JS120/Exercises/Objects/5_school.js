School

Create a `school` object. The `school` object uses the `student` object from the previous exercise. It has methods that use and update information about the student. Be sure to check out the previous exercise for the other arguments that might be needed by the school object. Implement the following methods for the `school` object:

- `addStudent`: Adds a student by creating a new student and adding the student to a collection of students. The method adds a constraint that the year can only be any of the following values: '1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th', or '5th'. Returns a student object if year is valid otherwise it logs "Invalid Year".

- `enrollStudent`: Enrolls a student in a course.

- `addGrade`: Adds the grade of a student for a course.

- `getReportCard`: Logs the grades of a student for all courses. If the course has no grade, it uses "In progress" as the grade.

- `courseReport`: Logs the grades of all students for a given course name. Only student with grades are part of the course report.

To test your code, use the three student objects listed below. Using the three student objects, produce the following values from the `getReportCard` and `courseReport` methods respectively. */

/* Examples of created student objects with grades; methods on the objects are not shown here for brevity. The following are only showing the properties that aren't methods for the three objects. */

/* Hint

The challenge for this question is locating the student to enroll, add a grade to, and generate the report card for. The key here is the returned value of the `addStudent` method.

Discussion

The key to the enrollStudent, addGrade, and getReportCard method is the use of the student object as a parameter. With the student object, the three methods just use the methods and properties of the object to update the information on the student object. Although not passed as an argument, the key also for the courseReport method is using the methods on the student object and then using list processing techniques to convert the list of students to the appropriate data needed to log the scores and average for a course. Of note is the use of map to transform the student object to only contain the name and grade of the student for a course.
