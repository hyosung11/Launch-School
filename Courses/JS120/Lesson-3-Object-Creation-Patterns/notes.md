# Lesson 3: Object Creation Patterns

## 1. Introduction

In lesson 1, we saw the power of an object creation mechanism when we studied the **object factory pattern** for creating objects. In this lesson, we'll review that pattern, and talk about some other patterns.

Unlike other mainstream languages, JavaScript doesn't implement behavior sharing using class-based inheritance even though ES6 introduced the class keyword to the language. Instead, it *uses the object prototype to share properties*. This distinction is crucial to understanding how JavaScript generates individual objects; it forms the basis of all object-creation patterns in JavaScript that feature behavior sharing.

We'll begin by looking at different ways to generate individual objects and then explore object prototypes. Next, we'll highlight two ways to create objects in an object-oriented pattern - one which simulates a classical approach, and another that uses the `class` syntax.

The topics covered by this lesson are at the heart of OOP in JavaScript. Prototype-based object-orientation is not a straightforward concept to grasp, and it takes time to get used to this way of thinking. Take it slow, read the assignment multiple times, and be sure to work through all the practice problems to let the concepts sink in. Let's start!

## 2. Review - OOP Principles: Encapsulation

In the previous course, we dealt mostly with procedural programming where we have data stored in a bunch of variables, and functions that operate on this data. As the program grows, so does the complexity and, before you know it, you end up with functions all throughout the code split up from the data that they operate on.

Object-oriented programming solves this problem. Objects provide a means to group related data and functions into one unit. In the context of the object, the data and functions are commonly called state and methods respectively.

### 2.1 Encapsulation

This grouping together of related data and functions is what’s called **encapsulation** and is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

To illustrate, let’s take the following code:

```js
let overtime = 10;
let baseSalary = 6000;
let rate = 50;

function computeWage(baseSalary, overtime, rate) {
  return baseSalary + (overtime * rate)
}
```

Up top are the data related to the employee’s wage and a function that operates on the data. The object-oriented way of solving this problem by using encapsulation is done by simply combining data and related functions into one unit like so:

```js
let employee = {
  baseSalary: 6000,
  overtime: 10,
  rate: 50,
  computeWage: function() {
    return this.baseSalary + (this.overtime * this.rate)
  }
}
```

As you can see, everything that's related to the `employee` object is bundled. This is the beauty of object-oriented programming. It organizes code into logical units.

### 2.2 Review - OOP Principles: Encapsulation Summary

We've just reviewed the concept of encapsulation and how it's relevant to object-oriented programming. In the example given, we *instantiated an object using the object literal syntax*. There are other more sophisticated patterns of object creation that we'll cover over the remaining assignments. However keep in mind that, at the very core, we are essentially doing the same thing: *grouping data and related functions together*.

## 3. Review - Factory Functions

In lesson 1, we learned how to *create objects in bulk* by using the factory function pattern. We'll review that concept before we move forward and discuss some other object creation patterns.

### 3.1 Factory Functions

Object factories, or factory functions (also called the Factory Object Creation Pattern), provide a simple way to create related objects based on a predefined template:

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName = '') {
  let person = {};

  person.firstName = firstName;
  person.lastName = lastName;

  person.fullName = function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`.trim();
  };

  return person;
}

let john = createPerson('John', 'Doe');
let jane = createPerson('Jane');

john.fullName(); // => 'John Doe'
jane.fullName(); // => 'Jane'
```

We can simplify that somewhat by returning an object literal:

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName = '') {
  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,

    fullName: function() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`.trim();
    }
  };
}
```

The factory function lets us create multiple objects of the same "type" with a pre-defined "template." However, it has some disadvantages:

- Every object created with a factory function has a full copy of all the methods. That's **redundant**, and it can place a heavy load on system memory.

- There is no way to inspect an object and learn whether we created it with a factory function. That effectively *makes it impossible to identify the specific "type" of the object*; at best, you can only determine that an object has some specific characteristics.

## 4. Practice Problems - Factory Functions

### 4.1 What are two disadvantages of working with factory functions?

1. Every object created with a factory function has a full copy of all the methods. That's redundant, and it can place a heavy load on system memory.

2. There is no way to inspect an object and learn whether we created it with a factory function. That effectively makes it impossible to identify the specific "type" of the object; at best, you can only determine that an object has some specific characteristics.

**Solution**

1. Each object created by a factory function has a copy of all methods, which can be redundant and memory intensive.

2. There is no way to tell which factory function created an object, so there's no way to be sure that you're working with the right kind of object.
