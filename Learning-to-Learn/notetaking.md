### How to take great textbook notes

#### Before you start

1. Review the assigned reading list
2. Create an outline
   - skim the chapter
      - read the introduction
      - read the conclusion
   - write down the headings and subheadings (using an outline method)

#### Steps for taking notes as you read

1. Always start from the beginning
2. Read one section at a time
3. Use your memory to start your notes
   - once you have read a section, close your book and fill in the key points on the outline you made before you started
   - working from memory will help you make sure you paid attention to what you were reading and helps you recall the information later when studying
4. Add important details
   - open your book, skim the section again and add any important information you missed when writing from memory
   - this helps make sure your notes are accurate
5. Repeat for all sections
   - repeat this process for all of the sections in your assigned reading
   - take breaks between sections to help keep focused while reading
6. Summarize the reading
   - write a few sentences at the end of your notes to summarize what contents of the chapter
   - when reviewing for a test, reading your summary will help trigger your memory for the concepts covered in the chapter
