[How to Create and Practice Flashcards Like a Boss](https://medium.com/@iDoRecall/https-medium-com-idorecall-how-to-create-and-practice-flashcards-like-a-boss-b7efb5a53293)

* flashcards are utilized for building easy recall of the things that you’ve already learned.
* Create your flashcards while consuming your learning content. (When I use the word content, I’m referring to the academic materials that you can read, watch or listen to.)
* read things only once.
* The only active approach is to _practice retrieving what you learn from memory_.
* Read once and create flashcards as you work your way through the material:
  * capture all the concepts and facts you want to remember
  * Once you have processed that piece of learning content, meaning once you have read it in its entirety and created the necessary flashcards, mark it as completed. 
  * Then use the flashcards and retrieval practice as your primary tools for remembering the key concepts and facts forever.
* When you create a flashcard, draft the question and answer from memory.
* On every flashcard, ask only one question and whenever possible, only one answer.
* the most challenging flashcards are the ones where you have to retrieve a large collection of items from memory.
* keep the question concise but make it just long enough to be explicit and clear
* carefully craft your question to elicit the best and most complete answer
  * think like a trial attorney who is examining a witness
* it's better for a question to be longer than the answer
* keep answers short, simple and specific to stimulate synpatic strengthening.
* use a combination of words and images -- dual coding -- to encode the question because it's easier to retrieve from memory
* You can use an image as the question
* Use colors and rich text formatting to make the text more memorable
* use humor, narrative and personal examples to make flashcards more interesting
* create flashcards for the most important facts that represent the core material you'll be expected to know (don't make cards for unimportant things)
* create flashcards for both directions
* use screengrabs (screenshots) liberally
* break it down into its component parts and test your comprehension
* use tags to organize your recalls (sessions) and library items
* append a metacognitive question to the end of the answer
* use cloze deletion questions
* Open-ended questions are more challenging than cloze deletion type or multiple-choice questions.
* use flashcards answers as an opportunity to build associations with other parts of your knowledgebase
* craft why questions - deeper level of knowledge of understanding
  * what is cancer (shallow) vs why does cancer exist in nature (deeper)
* create multiple flashcards for the same concept that examine it from different viewpoints
* use mnemonic devices
  * acronyms
  * rhymes too
  * memory palace, especially for enumerations

Practice Process

* make a solid effort to retrieve the answer from memory first (retrieval practice, duh)
  * if unsuccessful, admit that you don't recall the answer
* tag each course and use additional tags for different topics within a subject
  * use interleaving to enhance the power of practice
* use spaced-repetition and manual study
* respond out loud - talk to yourself to promote metacognition
* edit cards during practice to fix errors, add new learning and highlight areas of struggle
* go back to source content to refresh your memory if you struggle with an answer
* study in new contexts - time and location
* practice before you sleep to take advantage of sleep's memory consolidation powers
* break up practice sessions into several pieces to make them less tedious
