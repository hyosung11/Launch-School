# PEDAC => process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C)

PROBLEM

1. Read the problem description.
2. Identify expected inputs and outputs.
3. Identify rules/requirements.
4. Understand the problem domain (including implicit requirements).
5. Make the requirements explicit (ask clarifying questions).
6. Create mental model of the problem (optional).

EXAMPLES / TEST CASES

1. Validate understanding of the problem.
2. Understand how the input translates to output.
3. Identify edge cases: e.g., 0, "", [], {}.
4. Create test cases and confirm outputs if necessary.

DATA STRUCTURE

1. Determine what kind of data you are dealing with primarily: strings, numbers, arrays, objects, etc.
2. Consider how to represent the data when converting the input to output and what methods to use:

- input
- intermediary
- output

ALGORITHM

1. Manifest steps for converting input to output.
2. Handle edge cases and valid example inputs.
3. Use your algorithm to determine how to code.

CODE

1. Implement the algorithm as you write the code.
2. Use everything you've gathered from PEDA.
3. Test code while programming.
4. Debug
   1. check for errors in output
   2. carefully review algorithm before looking at your code
   3. once you've identified the issue, change the algorithm first, then fix the code
   4. try again
5. Solve the problem.
