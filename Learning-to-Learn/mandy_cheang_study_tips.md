# Mandy Cheang Study Tips from Slack Message

Good morning!
My best tips would probably be:

* mindset, have a growth mindset

* be kind and patient to yourself, take breaks and rest when you need. Your brain also is working in the backend when you're resting. (diffuse mode)

* be self aware, iterate through your process of learning, get feedback, and ask structure questions when you don't understand. So "I tried this and that, my mental model is currently is this. But I don't know what is happening when the output is X, when I expect it to be Y."

* active recall, flash cards, teaching, but have some way to evaluate yourself or something else to evaluate you

* mistakes are opportunities

* try to make as MANY mistakes as you can and figure out the gaps in your knowledge before the assessment / interview

* I use to "highlight and re-read" all the time, it's not effective.

* I do take notes but I take notes in question form and convert them to anki flash cards

* If you are struggling, don't try to tackle everything at once, break it down to the pieces and tackle each piece incrementally. Then everything will come together as a whole. Ex. You can't solve a coding problem within 20 minutes. It's not very effective if you keep coding with other students without working on yourself and the individual pieces your struggling with. In order to get faster, practice being familiar at the methods you can use, be rock solid on loops and iterations,then practice breaking down the problem, practice the algorithm. These are all pieces you can practice individually and be aware which pieces your struggling with and try to tackle that. It's like weight-lifting or playing a sport. If you want to have a strong full body or your training for a sport, you work on biceps for a while, then you work on legs, then everything comes together as a whole.

* Don't worry about learning how to study, it's not a detriment of actually studying. I spent months iterating and learning more on how to learn. It pays dividends and your efforts will compound overtime. Learning how to learn effectively has been the best investment in my life.

* Ok that was a lot. I have more resources for you if you're interested in taking a look. These things have helped me:

* One last great tip is, study with others. If you haven't already, check out the #the-spot you can find a lot of other students on the same course, same path.
