Still trying to figure out how best to use Anki cards.
What about agile/scrum development processes to go through the core curriculum?
accountability
daily standup meeting?
work in sprints?
user stories
study group?
LS Slack channel and community
cleaned up the office a little bit
a little tired and scattered at the moment. i had trouble sleeping last night as my mind felt excited to get to work. that's a good sign. this does feel like play to me. i'm having fun and enjoying myself

what type of role and in what kind of company do I want to work?
look at LS95 again

tired today. skipped the first quiz. I want to make my anki cards for the Prep courses and do at least one small problems set


[Six Rules for Good Git Hygiene](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2)

Always `pull` before a `push`.
`pull` frequently.
`push` frequently.
Commit frequently.
* Commit small, single changes with carefully crafted commit messages that tell what the small, discrete change is.
* If you need to use the word 'and', you are not committing enough.

Merge `forward` frequently.
Create `pull requests` infrequently.

study buddy
spent a lot of time reviewing the anki cards I made yesterday. I want to make more cards today before I do problems and take the quiz

14:28 still reviewing the Introduction to Programming book and making Anki cards. This is beneficial.

16:12 More review. God, I need to work on the problems instead of just looking at the answer.

17:55 I think reviewing the fundamentals will pay off later.

20:33 Finished Anki cards on arrays.
